Here a sequential set of methods for detecting and filtering drug safety signals in longitudinal databases is presented. METHOD: Longitudinal GPS (LGPS) is a modification of the Gamma Poisson Shrinker (GPS) that uses person time rather than case counts for the estimation of the expected number of events. Longitudinal Evaluation of Observational Profiles of Adverse events Related to Drugs (LEOPARD) is a method that can be used to automatically discard false drug-event associations caused by protopathic bias or misclassification of the dates of the adverse events by comparing prior event prescription rates to post event prescription rates. LEOPARD can generate a single test statistic, or a visualization that can be used for more qualitative information on the relationship between drug and event. Both methods were evaluated using data simulated using the Observational medical dataset SIMulator (OSIM), including the dataset used in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) cup, a recent public competition for signal detection methods. The Mean Average Precision (MAP) was used for performance measurement. RESULTS: On the OMOP cup data, LGPS achieved a MAP of 0.245, and the combination of LGPS and LEOPARD achieved a MAP of 0.260, the highest score in the competition. CONCLUSIONS: The sequential use of LGPS and LEOPARD have proven to be a useful novel set of methods for drug safety signal detection on longitudinal health records.",Methods for drug safety signal detection in longitudinal observational databases: LGPS and LEOPARD.,"['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*statistics & numerical data', 'Databases, Factual/*statistics & numerical data', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Models, Statistical']",,

Data analysts often find robust clinical data models difficult to understand and ill suited to support their analytic approaches. Further, some models do not facilitate the computations required for systematic analysis across many interventions and outcomes for large datasets. Translating the data from these idiosyncratic data models to a common data model (CDM) could facilitate both the analysts' understanding and the suitability for large-scale systematic analysis. In addition to facilitating analysis, a suitable CDM has to faithfully represent the source observational database. Before beginning to use the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM and a related dictionary of standardized terminologies for a study of large-scale systematic active safety surveillance, the authors validated the model's suitability for this use by example. VALIDATION BY EXAMPLE: To validate the OMOP CDM, the model was instantiated into a relational database, data from 10 different observational healthcare databases were loaded into separate instances, a comprehensive array of analytic methods that operate on the data model was created, and these methods were executed against the databases to measure performance. CONCLUSION: There was acceptable representation of the data from 10 observational databases in the OMOP CDM using the standardized terminologies selected, and a range of analytic methods was developed and executed with sufficient performance to be useful for active safety surveillance.",Validation of a common data model for active safety surveillance research.,"['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems', '*Databases, Factual', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Observation', '*Pharmacovigilance', 'Terminology as Topic']",,

METHODS: Literature searches were conducted using PubMed and the citation database of the Iowa Drug Information Service. Embase was searched for some outcomes. The searches were based on a strategy developed by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) researchers. All citations were reviewed by two investigators. Exclusion criteria were applied at abstract and full-text review stages to ultimately identify algorithm validation studies that used data sources from the USA or Canada, as the results of these studies were considered most likely to generalize to Mini-Sentinel data. Nonvalidated algorithms were reviewed if fewer than five algorithm validation studies were identified. RESULTS: The results of this project are described in the separate articles and reports written on algorithms to identify each outcome of interest. CONCLUSIONS: The Mini-Sentinel systematic reviews of algorithms to identify health outcomes in administrative and claims data are expected to be relatively complete, despite some limitations. Algorithm validation studies are inconsistently indexed in PubMed, creating challenges in conducting systematic reviews of these studies.

We evaluated how vocabulary mapping affected (1) the retention of clinical data from two test databases, (2) the semantic space of outcome definitions, (3) the prevalence of each outcome in the test databases, and (4) the reliability of analytic methods designed to detect drug-outcome associations in the test databases. Although vocabulary mapping affected the semantic space of some outcome definitions, as well as the prevalence of some outcomes in the test databases, it had only minor effects on the analysis of drug-outcome associations.

METHODS: We studied the performance of eight analytic methods for estimating of the strength of association-relative risk (RR) and associated standard error of 53 drug-adverse event outcome pairs, both positive and negative controls. The methods were applied to a network of ten observational healthcare databases, comprising over 130 million lives. Performance measures included sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of methods at RR thresholds achieving statistical significance of p < 0.05 or p < 0.001 and with absolute threshold RR > 1.5, as well as threshold-free measures such as area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Although no specific method demonstrated superior performance, the aggregate results provide a benchmark and baseline expectation for risk identification method performance. At traditional levels of statistical significance (RR > 1, p < 0.05), all methods have a false positive rate >18%, with positive predictive value <38%. The best predictive model, high-dimensional propensity score, achieved an AUC  =  0.77. At 50% sensitivity, false positive rate ranged from 16% to 30%. At 10% false positive rate, sensitivity of the methods ranged from 9% to 33%.

However, it is challenging to perform analyses across these heterogeneous data sources. The Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) provides a Common Data Model (CDM) for organizing and standardizing databases. OMOP's work with the CDM has primarily focused on US databases. As a participant in the OMOP Extended Consortium, we implemented the OMOP CDM on the UK Electronic Healthcare Record database-The Health Improvement Network (THIN). OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the implementation of the THIN database in the OMOP CDM and explore its use for active drug safety surveillance. METHODS: Following the OMOP CDM specification, the raw THIN database was mapped into a CDM THIN database. Ten Drugs of Interest (DOI) and nine Health Outcomes of Interest (HOI), defined and focused by the OMOP, were created using the CDM THIN database. Quantitative comparison of raw THIN to CDM THIN was performed by execution and analysis of OMOP standardized reports and additional analyses. The practical value of CDM THIN for drug safety and pharmacoepidemiological research was assessed by implementing three analysis methods: Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Univariate Self-Case Control Series (USCCS) and High-Dimensional Propensity Score (HDPS). A published study using raw THIN data was selected to examine the external validity of CDM THIN. RESULTS: Overall demographic characteristics were the same in both databases. Mapping medical and drug codes into the OMOP terminology dictionary was incomplete: 25 % medical codes and 55 % drug codes in raw THIN were not listed in the OMOP terminology dictionary, representing 6 % condition occurrence counts, 4 % procedure occurrence counts and 7 % drug exposure counts in raw THIN. Seven DOIs had <0.3 % and three DOIs had 1 % of unmapped drug exposure counts; each HOI had at least one definition with no or minimal (</=0.2 %) issues with unmapped condition occurrence counts, except for the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) ulcer hospitalization cohort. The application of PRR, USCCS and HDPS found, respectively, a sensitivity of 67, 78 and 50 %, and a specificity of 68, 59 and 76 %, suggesting that safety issues defined as known by the OMOP could be identified in CDM THIN, with imperfect performance. Similar PRR scores were produced using both CDM THIN and raw THIN, while the execution time was twice as fast on CDM THIN. There was close replication of demographic distribution, death rate and prescription pattern and trend in the published study population and the cohort of CDM THIN. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated that information loss due to incomplete mapping of medical and drug codes as well as data structure in the current CDM THIN limits its use for all possible epidemiological evaluation studies. Current HOIs and DOIs predefined by the OMOP were constructed with minimal loss of information and can be used for active surveillance methodological research.

Opioid code sets were created for each of the three classification systems and the number of identified codes was summarized. We estimated the prevalence of opioid exposure in three observational healthcare databases using the three defined code sets. In addition we compared the number of drug codes and distinct ingredients that were identified using these classification systems. We found substantial variation in the prevalence of opioid exposure identified using an individual classification system versus a composite method using multiple classification systems.

METHODS: Performance measures were produced for each setting, including sensitivity (recall), specificity (1-FPR), AUC, MAP, and P(k). Multiple regressions with relevant parameters as main effects were run for performance measures on all test cases and subgroups. Heatmaps with sequential palettes to indicate the parameters' impacts on performance measures were generated based on matrices of the standardized coefficients (t-statistics) by parameter settings and test case subgroups. RESULTS: Heatmaps help researchers to explore design and analysis options of methods for evaluating a variety of drug-outcome relationships and also to explore data issues.

However, despite obvious similarities, a consensus standard has not yet been selected in the comparative effectiveness research (CER) community. METHODS: Using qualitative metrics for data retrieval and information loss across a variety of CER topic areas, we compare several existing models from a representative sample of organizations associated with clinical research: the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP), Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group, the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium, and the US Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: While the models examined captured a majority of the data elements that are useful for CER studies, data elements related to insurance benefit design and plans were most detailed in OMOP's CDM version 4.0. Standardized vocabularies that facilitate semantic interoperability were included in the OMOP and US Food and Drug Administration Mini-Sentinel data models, but are left to the discretion of the end-user in Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group and Analysis Data Model, limiting reuse opportunities. Among the challenges we encountered was the need to model data specific to a local setting. This was handled by extending the standard data models. DISCUSSION: We found that the Common Data Model from the OMOP met the broadest complement of CER objectives. Minimal information loss occurred in mapping data from institution-specific data warehouses onto the data models from the standards we assessed.

The underlying premise is that at this threshold, there is only a 5% probability that the observed effect would be seen by chance when in reality there is no effect. In observational studies, much more than in randomized trials, bias and confounding may undermine this premise. To test this premise, we selected three exemplar drug safety studies from literature, representing a case-control, a cohort, and a self-controlled case series design. We attempted to replicate these studies as best we could for the drugs studied in the original articles. Next, we applied the same three designs to sets of negative controls: drugs that are not believed to cause the outcome of interest. We observed how often p < 0.05 when the null hypothesis is true, and we fitted distributions to the effect estimates. Using these distributions, we compute calibrated p-values that reflect the probability of observing the effect estimate under the null hypothesis, taking both random and systematic error into account. An automated analysis of scientific literature was performed to evaluate the potential impact of such a calibration. Our experiment provides evidence that the majority of observational studies would declare statistical significance when no effect is present. Empirical calibration was found to reduce spurious results to the desired 5% level.

RESULTS: There is little consistency across scenarios, by drug or by outcome of interest, in the decisions made for design and analyses in scenarios using large healthcare databases. The most consistent choice was the cohort study design but variability in the other critical decisions was common. CONCLUSIONS: There is great variation among epidemiologists in the design and analytical choices that they make when implementing analyses in observational healthcare databases. These findings confirm that it will be important to generate empiric evidence to inform these decisions and to promote a better understanding of the impact of standardization on research implementation.",Variation in choice of study design: findings from the Epidemiology Design Decision Inventory and Evaluation (EDDIE) survey.,"['Data Collection', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis', '*Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', '*Research Design']",,

In drug safety, the performance of analyses of spontaneous adverse event reporting databases and observational healthcare data, such as administrative claims and electronic health records, has been limited by the lack of such standards. OBJECTIVES: To establish a reference set of test cases that contain both positive and negative controls, which can serve the basis for methodological research in evaluating methods performance in identifying drug safety issues. RESEARCH DESIGN: Systematic literature review and natural language processing of structured product labeling was performed to identify evidence to support the classification of drugs as either positive controls or negative controls for four outcomes: acute liver injury, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial infarction, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. RESULTS: Three-hundred and ninety-nine test cases comprised of 165 positive controls and 234 negative controls were identified across the four outcomes. The majority of positive controls for acute kidney injury and upper gastrointestinal bleeding were supported by randomized clinical trial evidence, while the majority of positive controls for acute liver injury and acute myocardial infarction were only supported based on published case reports. Literature estimates for the positive controls shows substantial variability that limits the ability to establish a reference set with known effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: A reference set of test cases can be established to facilitate methodological research in drug safety. Creating a sufficient sample of drug-outcome pairs with binary classification of having no effect (negative controls) or having an increased effect (positive controls) is possible and can enable estimation of predictive accuracy through discrimination. Since the magnitude of the positive effects cannot be reliably obtained and the quality of evidence may vary across outcomes, assumptions are required to use the test cases in real data for purposes of measuring bias, mean squared error, or coverage probability.",Defining a reference set to support methodological research in drug safety.,"['Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/diagnosis', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Myocardial Infarction/chemically induced', 'Research Design/*standards']",,

BACKGROUND: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership is conducting methodological research to develop a system to monitor drug safety. Standard processes and tools are needed to ensure continuous data quality across a network of disparate databases, and to ensure that procedures used to extract-transform-load (ETL) processes maintain data integrity. Currently, there is no consensus or standard approach to evaluate the quality of the source data, or ETL procedures. METHODS: We propose a framework for a comprehensive process to ensure data quality throughout the steps used to process and analyze the data. The approach used to manage data anomalies includes: (1) characterization of data sources; (2) detection of data anomalies; (3) determining the cause of data anomalies; and (4) remediation. FINDINGS: Data anomalies included incomplete raw dataset: no race or year of birth recorded. Implausible data: year of birth exceeding current year, observation period end date precedes start date, suspicious data frequencies and proportions outside normal range. Examples of errors found in the ETL process were zip codes incorrectly loaded, drug quantities rounded, drug exposure length incorrectly calculated, and condition length incorrectly programmed.

RESULTS: The new user cohort method achieved modest predictive accuracy across the outcomes and databases under study, with the top-performing analysis near AUC >0.70 in most scenarios. The performance of the method was particularly sensitive to the choice of comparator population. For almost all drug-outcome pairs there was a large difference, either positive or negative, between the true effect size and the estimate produced by the method, although this error was near zero on average. Simulation studies showed that in the majority of cases, the true effect estimate was not within the 95 % confidence interval produced by the method.

OBJECTIVE: To replicate the OMOP experiment in six European EHR databases. RESEARCH DESIGN: Six databases of the EU-ADR (Exploring and Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions) database network participated in this study: Aarhus (Denmark), ARS (Italy), HealthSearch (Italy), IPCI (the Netherlands), Pedianet (Italy), and Pharmo (the Netherlands).

Area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) was computed per database and for a combination of all six databases using meta-analysis for random effects. We provide expected values of estimation error as well, based on negative controls. RESULTS: Similarly to the US experiment, high predictive accuracy was found (AUC >0.8) for some analyses.

RESULTS: OSIM2 replicates prevalence and types of confounding observed in real claims data.

For each HOI, multiple definitions are used in the literature, and some of them are validated for certain databases. However, little is known about the effect of different definitions on the ability of methods to estimate their association with medical products. OBJECTIVES: Alternative definitions of HOI were studied for their effect on the performance of analytical methods in observational outcome studies. METHODS: A set of alternative definitions for three HOI were defined based on literature review and clinical diagnosis guidelines: acute kidney injury, acute liver injury and acute myocardial infarction. The definitions varied by the choice of diagnostic codes and the inclusion of procedure codes and lab values. They were then used to empirically study an array of analytical methods with various analytical choices in four observational healthcare databases. The methods were executed against predefined drug-HOI pairs to generate an effect estimate and standard error for each pair. These test cases included positive controls (active ingredients with evidence to suspect a positive association with the outcome) and negative controls (active ingredients with no evidence to expect an effect on the outcome). Three different performance metrics where used: (i) Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) as a measure of a method's ability to distinguish between positive and negative test cases, (ii) Measure of bias by estimation of distribution of observed effect estimates for the negative test pairs where the true effect can be assumed to be one (no relative risk), and (iii) Minimal Detectable Relative Risk (MDRR) as a measure of whether there is sufficient power to generate effect estimates. RESULTS: In the three outcomes studied, different definitions of outcomes show comparable ability to differentiate true from false control cases (AUC) and a similar bias estimation. However, broader definitions generating larger outcome cohorts allowed more drugs to be studied with sufficient statistical power.

However, the rates of drug exposure and outcome occurrences in observational databases, the database size and the desired risk detection threshold determine the power and therefore limit the feasibility of the application of appropriate analytical methods. Drugs vary dramatically for these parameters because of their prevalence of indication, cost, time on the market, payer formularies, market pressures and clinical guidelines. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate (i) the feasibility of a risk identification system based on commercially available observational databases, (ii) the range of drugs that can be studied for certain outcomes, (iii) the influence of underpowered drug-outcome pairs on the performance of analytical methods estimating the strength of their association and (iv) the time required from the introduction of a new drug to accumulate sufficient data for signal detection. METHODS: As part of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership experiment, we used data from commercially available observational databases and calculated the minimal detectable relative risk of all pairs of marketed drugs and eight health outcomes of interest. We then studied an array of analytical methods for their ability to distinguish between pre-determined positive and negative drug-outcome test pairs. The positive controls contained active ingredients with evidence of a positive association with the outcome, and the negative controls had no such evidence. As a performance measure we used the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC). We compared the AUC of methods using all test pairs or only pairs sufficiently powered for detection of a relative risk of 1.25. Finally, we studied all drugs introduced to the market in 2003-2008 and determined the time required to achieve the same minimal detectable relative risk threshold. RESULTS: The performance of methods improved after restricting them to fully powered drug-outcome pairs. The availability of drug-outcome pairs with sufficient power to detect a relative risk of 1.25 varies enormously among outcomes. Depending on the market uptake, drugs can generate relevant signals in the first month after approval, or never reach sufficient power.

DESIGN: Population based retrospective cohort study (between patient methodology) and self controlled case series (within patient methodology). SETTING: Healthcare claims data from the IMS Lifelink database in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Men aged 40-85 years with private US healthcare insurance entering the cohort at their first dispensing for tamsulosin or for a 5alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI) between January 2001 and June 2011 after a minimum of six months' enrolment. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Hypotension requiring admission to hospital. Cox proportional hazards models estimated rate ratios at time varying intervals during follow-up: weeks 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12 after tamsulosin initiation; weeks 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12 after restarting tamsulosin (after a four week gap); and maintenance tamsulosin treatment (remaining exposed person time). Covariates included age, calendar year, demographics, antihypertensive use, healthcare use, and a Charlson comorbidity score. A self controlled case series, having implicit control for time invariant covariates, was additionally conducted. RESULTS: Among 383,567 new users of study drugs (tamsulosin 297,596; 5ARI 85,971), 2562 admissions to hospital for severe hypotension were identified. The incidence for hypotension was higher for tamsulosin (42.4 events per 10,000 person years) than for 5ARIs (31.3 events per 10,000 person years) or all accrued person time (29.1 events per 10,000 person years). After tamsulosin initiation, the cohort analysis identified an increased rate of hypotension during weeks 1-4 (rate ratio 2.12 (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 3.04)) and 5-8 (1.51 (1.04 to 2.18)), and no significant increase at weeks 9-12. The rate ratio for hypotension also increased at weeks 1-4 (1.84 (1.46 to 2.33)) and 5-8 (1.85 (1.45 to 2.36)) after restarting tamsulosin, as did maintenance tamsulosin treatment (1.19 (1.07 to 1.32)). The self controlled case series gave similar results as the cohort analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a temporal association between tamsulosin use for benign prostatic hyperplasia and severe hypotension during the first eight weeks after initiating treatment and the first eight weeks after restarting treatment. This association suggests that physicians should focus on improving counseling strategies to warn patients regarding the ""first dose phenomenon"" with tamsulosin.",Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40-85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology.,"['5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Hypotension/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prostatic Hyperplasia/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sulfonamides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Tamsulosin', 'United States']",,

The motivation behind combining multiple healthcare databases is the earlier detection and validation, and hence earlier management, of potential safety issues. Overall, the combination of multiple healthcare databases increases statistical sample size and heterogeneity of exposure for postmarketing drug and vaccine safety surveillance, despite posing several technical challenges. Healthcare databases generally differ by underlying healthcare systems, type of information collected, drug/vaccine and medical event coding systems and language. Therefore, harmonization of medical data extraction through homogeneous coding algorithms across highly different databases is necessary. Although no standard procedure is currently available to achieve this, several approaches have been developed in recent projects. Another main challenge involves choosing the work models for data management and analyses whilst respecting country-specific regulations in terms of data privacy and anonymization. Dedicated software (e.g. Jerboa) has been produced to deal with privacy issues by sharing only anonymized and aggregated data using a common data model. Finally, storage and safe access to the data from different databases requires the development of a proper remote research environment. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the potential, disadvantages, methodological issues and possible solutions concerning the conduct of postmarketing multidatabase drug and vaccine safety studies, as demonstrated by several international initiatives.",Combining multiple healthcare databases for postmarketing drug and vaccine safety surveillance: why and how?,"['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/organization & administration', '*Databases, Factual', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Needs Assessment', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/standards', 'Population Surveillance/methods', 'Product Surveillance, Postmarketing/*methods', 'Vaccines/standards']",,

With the availability of increasingly larger electronic health record and administrative claims databases comes the opportunity to monitor for potential adverse effects that occur only after prolonged exposure to a drug, but analysis methods are lacking. We propose an adaptation of the self-controlled case series design that uses the notion of accumulated exposure to capture long-term effects of drugs and evaluate extensions to correct for age and recurrent events. Several variations of the approach are tested on simulated data and two large insurance claims databases. To evaluate performance a set of positive and negative control drug-event pairs was created by medical experts based on drug product labels and review of the literature. Performance on the real data was measured using the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve. The best performing method achieved an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 0.86 in the largest database using a spline model, adjustment for age, and ignoring recurrent events, but it appears this performance can only be achieved with very large data sets.",Detecting adverse drug reactions following long-term exposure in longitudinal observational data: The exposure-adjusted self-controlled case series.,"['Databases, Factual', 'Drug Labeling', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Insurance Claim Reporting', 'Insurance, Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'ROC Curve', '*Research Design']",,

The knowledge base will make it simpler for practitioners to access, retrieve, and synthesize evidence so that they can reach a rigorous and accurate assessment of causal relationships between a given drug and HOI. Development of the knowledge base will proceed with the measureable goal of supporting an efficient and thorough evidence-based assessment of the effects of 1,000 active ingredients across 100 HOIs.

METHODS: Our data included 1,761 diabetes clinical trials and the electronic health records (EHR) of 26,120 patients with Type 2 diabetes who visited Columbia University Medical Center of New-York Presbyterian Hospital. The two populations were compared using the Generalizability Index for Study Traits (GIST) on the earliest diagnosis age and the mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values. RESULTS: Greater than 70% of Type 2 diabetes studies allow patients with HbA1c measures between 7 and 10.5, but less than 40% of studies allow HbA1c<7 and fewer than 45% of studies allow HbA1c>10.5. In the real-world population, only 38% of patients had HbA1c between 7 and 10.5, with 12% having values above the range and 52% having HbA1c<7. The GIST for HbA1c was 0.51. Most studies adopted broad age value ranges, with the most common restrictions excluding patients >80 or <18 years. Most of the real-world population fell within this range, but 2% of patients were <18 at time of first diagnosis and 8% were >80. The GIST for age was 0.75. CONCLUSIONS: We contribute a scalable method to profile and compare aggregated clinical trial target populations with EHR patient populations. We demonstrate that Type 2 diabetes studies are more generalizable with regard to age than they are with regard to HbA1c. We found that the generalizability of age increased from Phase 1 to Phase 3 while the generalizability of HbA1c decreased during those same phases. This method can generalize to other medical conditions and other continuous or binary variables. We envision the potential use of EHR data for examining the generalizability of clinical trials and for defining population-representative clinical trial eligibility criteria.",A distribution-based method for assessing the differences between clinical trial target populations and patient populations in electronic health records.,"['Academic Medical Centers/statistics & numerical data', 'Age Distribution', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/diagnosis', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Female', 'Glycated Hemoglobin/analysis', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Inpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Internet', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outpatients/statistics & numerical data', '*Patient Selection']",,

These studies begin by selecting a particular study design, such as a case control, cohort, or self-controlled design, and different authors can and do choose different designs for the same clinical question. Furthermore, published papers invariably report the study design but do not discuss the rationale for the specific choice. Studies of the same clinical question with different designs, however, can generate different results, sometimes with strikingly different implications. Even within a specific study design, authors make many different analytic choices and these too can profoundly impact results. In this paper, we systematically study heterogeneity due to the type of study design and due to analytic choices within study design. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted our analysis in 10 observational healthcare databases but mostly present our results in the context of the GE Centricity EMR database, an electronic health record database containing data for 11.2 million lives. We considered the impact of three different study design choices on estimates of associations between bisphosphonates and four particular health outcomes for which there is no evidence of an association. We show that applying alternative study designs can yield discrepant results, in terms of direction and significance of association. We also highlight that while traditional univariate sensitivity analysis may not show substantial variation, systematic assessment of all analytical choices within a study design can yield inconsistent results ranging from statistically significant decreased risk to statistically significant increased risk. Our findings show that clinical studies using observational databases can be sensitive both to study design choices and to specific analytic choices within study design. CONCLUSION: More attention is needed to consider how design choices may be impacting results and, when possible, investigators should examine a wide array of possible choices to confirm that significant findings are consistently identified.",Does design matter?

To address this limitation we sought to transform CPRD into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). METHODS: An extraction, transformation and loading process was developed, which detailed source code mappings, Read code domain classification, an imputation algorithm for drug duration and special handling of lifestyle/clinical data. Completeness and accuracy of the above elements were assessed. A final validation exercise involved replication of a published case-control study that examined use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the risk of first-time acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in raw CPRD data and the CPRD CDM. FINDINGS: All elements of the CPRD CDM transformation were assessed to be of high quality. 99.9 % of database condition records and 89.7 % of database drug records were mapped (majority unmapped drugs were devices and over-the-counter products); 3.1 % of duration imputations were deemed possibly erroneous and prevalences for selected conditions and drugs across CPRD raw and CDM data were equivalent. Results between the replication raw data and CDM study agreed for conditions, demographics and lifestyle data with slight NSAID exposure data loss owing to unmapped drugs. CONCLUSION: CPRD can be accurately transformed into the OMOP CDM with acceptable information loss across drugs, conditions and observations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six deidentified patient-level datasets were transformed to the OMOP CDM. We evaluated the extent of information loss that occurred through the standardization process. We developed a standardized analytic tool to replicate the cohort construction process from a published epidemiology protocol and applied the analysis to all 6 databases to assess time-to-execution and comparability of results. RESULTS: Transformation to the CDM resulted in minimal information loss across all 6 databases. Patients and observations excluded were due to identified data quality issues in the source system, 96% to 99% of condition records and 90% to 99% of drug records were successfully mapped into the CDM using the standard vocabulary. The full cohort replication and descriptive baseline summary was executed for 2 cohorts in 6 databases in less than 1 hour. DISCUSSION: The standardization process improved data quality, increased efficiency, and facilitated cross-database comparisons to support a more systematic approach to observational research. Comparisons across data sources showed consistency in the impact of inclusion criteria, using the protocol and identified differences in patient characteristics and coding practices across databases.

Severity is important for distinguishing among phenotypes; however other severity indices classify patient-level severity (e.g., mild vs. acute dermatitis) rather than phenotype-level severity (e.g., acne vs. myocardial infarction). Phenotype-level severity is independent of the individual patient's state and is relative to other phenotypes. Further, phenotype-level severity does not change based on the individual patient. For example, acne is mild at the phenotype-level and relative to other phenotypes. Therefore, a given patient may have a severe form of acne (this is the patient-level severity), but this does not effect its overall designation as a mild phenotype at the phenotype-level. METHODS: We present a method for classifying severity at the phenotype-level that uses the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms. Our method is called the Classification Approach for Extracting Severity Automatically from Electronic Health Records (CAESAR). CAESAR combines multiple severity measures - number of comorbidities, medications, procedures, cost, treatment time, and a proportional index term. CAESAR employs a random forest algorithm and these severity measures to discriminate between severe and mild phenotypes. RESULTS: Using a random forest algorithm and these severity measures as input, CAESAR differentiates between severe and mild phenotypes (sensitivity = 91.67, specificity = 77.78) when compared to a manually evaluated reference standard (k = 0.716). CONCLUSIONS: CAESAR enables researchers to measure phenotype severity from EHRs to identify phenotypes that are important for comparative effectiveness research.",Development and validation of a classification approach for extracting severity automatically from electronic health records.,,,

FINDINGS: The data transformed into the CDM resulted in 1% of the data being discarded due to data errors in the raw data. A total of 91.4% of Premier standard charge codes were mapped successfully to a standard vocabulary. The results of the replication study resulted in a similar distribution of patient characteristics. The comparison to the claims data yields notable similarities and differences amongst conditions represented in both databases. DISCUSSION: The transformation of the Premier database into the OMOP CDM version 4.0 adds value in conducting analyses due to successful mapping of the drugs and procedures. The addition of visit logic gives ordinality to drugs and procedures that wasn't present prior to the transformation. Comparing conditions in Premier against a claims database can provide an understanding about Premier's potential use in pharmacoepidemiology studies that are traditionally conducted via claims databases. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS: The conversion of the Premier database into the OMOP CDM 4.0 was completed successfully. The next steps include refinement of vocabularies and mappings and continual maintenance of the transformed CDM.",Transforming the Premier Perspective Hospital Database into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model.,,,

This paper evaluates the impact of applying a standardized revenue code-based logic for defining inpatient encounters across two different claims databases. METHODS: We selected members who had complete enrollment in 2012 from the Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) and the Optum Clinformatics (Optum) databases. The overall prevalence of inpatient conditions in the raw data was compared to that in the common data model (CDM) with the standardized visit definition applied. RESULTS: In CCAE, 87.18% of claims from 2012 that were classified as part of inpatient visits in the raw data were also classified as part of inpatient visits after the data were standardized to CDM, and this overlap was consistent from 2006 to 2011. In contrast, Optum had 83.18% concordance in classification of 2012 claims from inpatient encounters before and after standardization, but the consistency varied over time. The re-classification of inpatient encounters substantially impacted the observed prevalence of medical conditions occurring in the inpatient setting and the consistency in prevalence estimates between the databases. On average, before standardization, each condition in Optum was 12% more prevalent than that same condition in CCAE; after standardization, the prevalence of conditions had a mean difference of only 1% between databases. Amongst 7,039 conditions reviewed, the difference in the prevalence of 67% of conditions in these two databases was reduced after standardization. CONCLUSIONS: In an effort to improve consistency in research results across database one should review sources of database heterogeneity, such as the way data holders process raw claims data. Our study showed that applying the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM with a standardized approach for defining inpatient visits during the extract, transfer, and load process can decrease the heterogeneity observed in disease prevalence estimates across two different claims data sources.",The impact of standardizing the definition of visits on the consistency of multi-database observational health research.,"['Databases, Factual/classification/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Electronic Health Records/classification/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Health Surveys/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Inpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Insurance Claim Review/classification/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Office Visits/*statistics & numerical data', 'Reference Standards']",,

The growing availability of electronic administrative and clinical data is accompanied by a growing concern about the quality of these data for observational research and other analytic purposes. Currently, there are no widely accepted guidelines for reporting quality results that would enable investigators and consumers to independently determine if a data source is fit for use to support analytic inferences and reliable evidence generation. MODEL AND METHODS: We developed a conceptual model that captures the flow of data from data originator across successive data stewards and finally to the data consumer. This ""data lifecycle"" model illustrates how data quality issues can result in data being returned back to previous data custodians. We highlight the potential risks of poor data quality on clinical practice and research results. Because of the need to ensure transparent reporting of a data quality issues, we created a unifying data-quality reporting framework and a complementary set of 20 data-quality reporting recommendations for studies that use observational clinical and administrative data for secondary data analysis. We obtained stakeholder input on the perceived value of each recommendation by soliciting public comments via two face-to-face meetings of informatics and comparative-effectiveness investigators, through multiple public webinars targeted to the health services research community, and with an open access online wiki. RECOMMENDATIONS: Our recommendations propose reporting on both general and analysis-specific data quality features. The goals of these recommendations are to improve the reporting of data quality measures for studies that use observational clinical and administrative data, to ensure transparency and consistency in computing data quality measures, and to facilitate best practices and trust in the new clinical discoveries based on secondary use of observational data.",Transparent reporting of data quality in distributed data networks.,,,

Previous studies reveal relationships between birth month and several diseases including atherothrombosis, asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and myopia, leaving most diseases completely unexplored. This retrospective population study systematically explores the relationship between seasonal affects at birth and lifetime disease risk for 1688 conditions. METHODS: We developed a hypothesis-free method that minimizes publication and disease selection biases by systematically investigating disease-birth month patterns across all conditions. Our dataset includes 1 749 400 individuals with records at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center born between 1900 and 2000 inclusive. We modeled associations between birth month and 1688 diseases using logistic regression. Significance was tested using a chi-squared test with multiplicity correction. RESULTS: We found 55 diseases that were significantly dependent on birth month. Of these 19 were previously reported in the literature (P < .001), 20 were for conditions with close relationships to those reported, and 16 were previously unreported. We found distinct incidence patterns across disease categories. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime disease risk is affected by birth month.

However, interpreting results is difficult when treatment effect estimates vary across datasets (i.e., heterogeneity). In a previous study, risk estimates were generated for selected drugs and potential adverse outcomes. Analyses were replicated across eight distributed data sources using an identical analytic structure. To evaluate heterogeneity of risk estimates across data sources, the estimates were combined with summary-level data characterizing the population of each data source. Meta-analysis, meta-regression, and plots of the influence on overall results versus contribution to heterogeneity were examined and used to illustrate an approach to heterogeneity assessment. Heterogeneity, as measured by the I-squared statistic, was high with variability across outcomes. Plots of the relationship between influence on overall results and contribution to heterogeneity suggest that certain datasets and characteristics were influential but there was variability dependent on the drug and outcome being assessed. Exploratory meta-regression identified many possible influential factors, but may be subject to ecological bias and false positive conclusions.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate two drug safety surveillance CDMs from an ecosystem perspective to better understand how differences in CDMs and analytic tools affect usability and interpretation of results. METHODS: Humana claims data from 2007 to 2012 were mapped to Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) and Mini-Sentinel CDMs. Data were described and compared at the patient level by source code and mapped concepts. Study cohort construction and effect estimates were also compared using two different analytical methods--one based on a new user design implementing a high-dimensional propensity score (HDPS) algorithm and the other based on univariate self-controlled case series (SCCS) design--across six established positive drug-outcome pairs to learn how differences in CDMs and analytics influence steps in the database analytic process and results. RESULTS: Claims data for approximately 7.7 million Humana health plan members were transformed into the two CDMs. Three health outcome cohorts and two drug cohorts showed differences in cohort size and constituency between Mini-Sentinel and OMOP CDMs, which was a result of multiple factors. Overall, the implementation of the HDPS procedure on Mini-Sentinel CDM detected more known positive associations than that on OMOP CDM. The SCCS method results were comparable on both CDMs. Differences in the implementation of the HDPS procedure between the two CDMs were identified; analytic model and risk period specification had a significant impact on the performance of the HDPS procedure on OMOP CDM. CONCLUSIONS: Differences were observed between OMOP and Mini-Sentinel CDMs. The analysis of both CDMs at the data model level indicated that such conceptual differences had only a slight but not significant impact on identifying known safety associations. Our results show that differences at the ecosystem level of analyses across the CDMs can lead to strikingly different risk estimations, but this can be primarily attributed to the choices of analytic approach and their implementation in the community-developed analytic tools. The opportunities of using CDMs are clear, but our study shows the need for judicious comparison of analyses across the CDMs. Our work emphasizes the need for ongoing efforts to ensure sustainable transparent platforms to maintain and develop CDMs and associated tools for effective safety surveillance.",A Comparative Assessment of Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership and Mini-Sentinel Common Data Models and Analytics: Implications for Active Drug Safety Surveillance.,"['Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual/*statistics & numerical data', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Product Surveillance, Postmarketing/*statistics & numerical data', '*Sentinel Surveillance']",,

DDIs are responsible for many adverse drug effects (ADEs), decreasing patient quality of life and causing higher care expenses. DDIs are not systematically evaluated in pre-clinical or clinical trials and so the FDA U. S. Food and Drug Administration relies on post-marketing surveillance to monitor patient safety. However, existing pharmacovigilance algorithms show poor performance for detecting DDIs exhibiting prohibitively high false positive rates. Alternatively, methods based on chemical structure and pharmacological similarity have shown promise in adverse drug event detection. We hypothesize that the use of chemical biology data in a post hoc analysis of pharmacovigilance results will significantly improve the detection of dangerous interactions. Our model integrates a reference standard of DDIs known to cause arrhythmias with drug similarity data. To compare similarity between drugs we used chemical structure (both 2D and 3D molecular structure), adverse drug side effects, chemogenomic targets, drug indication classes, and known drug-drug interactions. We evaluated the method on external reference standards. Our results showed an enhancement of sensitivity, specificity and precision in different top positions with the use of similarity measures to rank the candidates extracted from pharmacovigilance data. For the top 100 DDI candidates, similarity-based modeling yielded close to twofold precision enhancement compared to the proportional reporting ratio (PRR). Moreover, the method helps in the DDI decision making through the identification of the DDI in the reference standard that generated the candidate.",Improving Detection of Arrhythmia Drug-Drug Interactions in Pharmacovigilance Data through the Implementation of Similarity-Based Modeling.,"['*Algorithms', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/*etiology', '*Drug Interactions', 'Humans', '*Pharmacovigilance']",,

Signal generation methods and drug safety studies based on these data facilitate the prospective monitoring of drug safety after approval, as has been recently required by EU law and the German Medicines Act. Despite its large size, a single healthcare database may include insufficient patients for the study of a very small number of drug-exposed patients or the investigation of very rare drug risks. For that reason, in the United States, efforts have been made to work on models that provide the linkage of data from different electronic healthcare databases for monitoring the safety of medicines after authorization in (i) the Sentinel Initiative and (ii) the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP). In July 2014, the pilot project Mini-Sentinel included a total of 178 million people from 18 different US databases. The merging of the data is based on a distributed data network with a common data model. In the European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCEPP) there has been no comparable merging of data from different databases; however, first experiences have been gained in various EU drug safety projects. In Germany, the data of the statutory health insurance providers constitute the most important resource for establishing a large healthcare database.

Unfortunately there are many complexities and underlying issues when analysing longitudinal observational data. Due to these complexities, existing methods for large-scale detection of negative side effects using observational data all tend to have issues distinguishing between association and causality. New methods that can better discriminate causal and non-causal relationships need to be developed to fully utilise the data. In this paper we propose using a set of causality considerations developed by the epidemiologist Bradford Hill as a basis for engineering features that enable the application of supervised learning for the problem of detecting negative side effects. The Bradford Hill considerations look at various perspectives of a drug and outcome relationship to determine whether it shows causal traits. We taught a classifier to find patterns within these perspectives and it learned to discriminate between association and causality. The novelty of this research is the combination of supervised learning and Bradford Hill's causality considerations to automate the Bradford Hill's causality assessment. We evaluated the framework on a drug safety gold standard known as the observational medical outcomes partnership's non-specified association reference set. The methodology obtained excellent discrimination ability with area under the curves ranging between 0.792 and 0.940 (existing method optimal: 0.73) and a mean average precision of 0.640 (existing method optimal: 0.141).

There are only several papers describing methods that integrate evidence from healthcare databases and SRSs. We propose a methodology that combines ADR signals from these two sources. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the proposed method would result in more accurate ADR detection than methods using SRSs or healthcare data alone. RESEARCH DESIGN: We applied the method to four clinically serious ADRs, and evaluated it using three experiments that involve combining an SRS with a single facility small-scale electronic health record (EHR), a larger scale network-based EHR, and a much larger scale healthcare claims database. The evaluation used a reference standard comprising 165 positive and 234 negative drug-ADR pairs. MEASURES: Area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) was computed to measure performance. RESULTS: There was no improvement in the AUC when the SRS and small-scale HER were combined. The AUC of the combined SRS and large-scale EHR was 0.82 whereas it was 0.76 for each of the individual systems.

There are a growing number of common data models (CDM), such as Mini-Sentinel, and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs. OBJECTIVES: In this case study, we describe the challenges and opportunities of a study specific use of the OMOP CDM by two health systems and describe three comparative effectiveness use cases developed from the CDM. METHODS: The project transformed two health system databases (using crosswalks provided) into the OMOP CDM. Cohorts were developed from the transformed CDMs for three comparative effectiveness use case examples. Administrative/billing, demographic, order history, medication, and laboratory were included in the CDM transformation and cohort development rules. RESULTS: Record counts per person month are presented for the eligible cohorts, highlighting differences between the civilian and federal datasets, e.g. the federal data set had more outpatient visits per person month (6.44 vs. 2.05 per person month). The count of medications per person month reflected the fact that one system's medications were extracted from orders while the other system had pharmacy fills and medication administration records. The federal system also had a higher prevalence of the conditions in all three use cases. Both systems required manual coding of some types of data to convert to the CDM. CONCLUSIONS: The data transformation to the CDM was time consuming and resources required were substantial, beyond requirements for collecting native source data. The need to manually code subsets of data limited the conversion. However, once the native data was converted to the CDM, both systems were then able to use the same queries to identify cohorts. Thus, the CDM minimized the effort to develop cohorts and analyze the results across the sites.",Creating a Common Data Model for Comparative Effectiveness with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership.,"['*Common Data Elements', '*Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Databases, Factual', 'Delivery of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods']",,

This paper presents an approach to integrate EHRs from heterogeneous resources and generate integrated data in different data formats or semantics to support various clinical research applications. The proposed approach builds semantic data virtualization layers on top of data sources, which generate data in the requested semantics or formats on demand. This approach avoids upfront dumping to and synchronizing of the data with various representations. Data from different EHR systems are first mapped to RDF data with source semantics, and then converted to representations with harmonized domain semantics where domain ontologies and terminologies are used to improve reusability. It is also possible to further convert data to application semantics and store the converted results in clinical research databases, e.g. i2b2, OMOP, to support different clinical research settings. Semantic conversions between different representations are explicitly expressed using N3 rules and executed by an N3 Reasoner (EYE), which can also generate proofs of the conversion processes.

However, laboratory test results across care sites are derived using different assays from varying patient populations, making it difficult to simply combine data for analysis. Additionally, existing normalization methods are not suitable for retrospective studies. We normalized laboratory results from different data sources by adjusting for heterogeneous clinico-epidemiologic characteristics of the data and called this the subgroup-adjusted normalization (SAN) method. METHODS: Subgroup-adjusted normalization renders the means and standard deviations of distributions identical under population structure-adjusted conditions. To evaluate its performance, we compared SAN with existing methods for simulated and real datasets consisting of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum potassium, and total bilirubin. Various clinico-epidemiologic characteristics can be applied together in SAN. For simplicity of comparison, age and gender were used to adjust population heterogeneity in this study. RESULTS: In simulations, SAN had the lowest standardized difference in means (SDM) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov values for all tests (p < 0.05). In a real dataset, SAN had the lowest SDM and Kolmogorov-Smirnov values for blood urea nitrogen, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and serum potassium, and the lowest SDM for serum creatinine (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Subgroup-adjusted normalization performed better than normalization using other methods.

However, their use may lead to unintended, negative medical outcomes commonly referred to as adverse drug reactions (ADRs). These effects vary widely in mechanism, severity, and populations affected, making ADR prediction and identification important public health concerns. Current methods rely on clinical trials and postmarket surveillance programs to find novel ADRs; however, clinical trials are limited by small sample size, whereas postmarket surveillance methods may be biased and inherently leave patients at risk until sufficient clinical evidence has been gathered. Systems pharmacology, an emerging interdisciplinary field combining network and chemical biology, provides important tools to uncover and understand ADRs and may mitigate the drawbacks of traditional methods. In particular, network analysis allows researchers to integrate heterogeneous data sources and quantify the interactions between biological and chemical entities. Recent work in this area has combined chemical, biological, and large-scale observational health data to predict ADRs in both individual patients and global populations. In this review, we explore the rapid expansion of systems pharmacology in the study of ADRs. We enumerate the existing methods and strategies and illustrate progress in the field with a model framework that incorporates crucial data elements, such as diet and comorbidities, known to modulate ADR risk. Using this framework, we highlight avenues of research that may currently be underexplored, representing opportunities for future work.",Systems biology approaches for identifying adverse drug reactions and elucidating their underlying biological mechanisms.,"['Animals', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Systems Biology/*methods']",,

METHODS: We extended a published metric named Generalizability Index for Study Traits (GIST) to include multiple study traits for quantifying the population representativeness of a set of related studies by assuming the independence and equal importance among all study traits. On this basis, we compared the effectiveness of GIST and multivariate GIST (mGIST) qualitatively. We further developed an algorithm called ""Multivariate Underrepresented Subgroup Identification"" (MAGIC) for constructing optimal combinations of distinct value intervals of multiple traits to define underrepresented subgroups in a set of related studies. Using Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as an example, we identified and extracted frequently used quantitative eligibility criteria variables in a set of clinical studies. We profiled the T2DM target population using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. RESULTS: According to the mGIST scores for four example variables, i.e., age, HbA1c, BMI, and gender, the included observational T2DM studies had superior population representativeness than the interventional T2DM studies. For the interventional T2DM studies, Phase I trials had better population representativeness than Phase III trials. People at least 65years old with HbA1c value between 5.7% and 7.2% were particularly underrepresented in the included T2DM trials. These results confirmed well-known knowledge and demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods in population representativeness assessment. CONCLUSIONS: mGIST is effective at quantifying population representativeness of related clinical studies using multiple numeric study traits.

In order to test such algorithms, attempts have been made to provide canonical reference lists of so-called 'positive controls' and 'negative controls'. Reference sets with even modest levels of misclassification may result in under- or overstatement of the performance of algorithms. AIM: We sought to determine the extent to which 'negative control' drug-event pairs in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) database are misclassified METHODS: We searched the medical literature for evidence of associations between drugs and events listed by OMOP as negative controls. RESULTS: The criteria used in OMOP to classify positive and negative controls are asymmetric; drug-event associations published only as case series or case reports are classified as positive controls if they are cited in Drug-Induced Diseases by Tisdale and Miller, but as negative controls if case series or case reports exist but are not cited in Tisdale and Miller. Of 233 drug-event pairs classified in the 2013 version of OMOP as negative controls, 21 failed to meet pre-specified OMOP adjudication criteria; in another 19 cases we found case reports, case series, or observational evidence that the drug and event are associated. Overall, OMOP misclassified, or may have misclassified, 40 (17 %) of all 'negative controls.' CONCLUSIONS: Results from studies of the performance of signal-detection algorithms based on the OMOP gold standard should be viewed with circumspection, because imperfect gold standards may lead to under/overstatement of absolute and relative signal detection algorithm performance. Improvements to OMOP would include omitting misclassified drug-event pairs, assigning more specific event labels, and using more extensive sources of information.",Evidence of Misclassification of Drug-Event Associations Classified as Gold Standard 'Negative Controls' by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP).,"['Algorithms', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations/*standards', 'Pharmacovigilance']",,

METHODS: We transformed the EHR of a hospital into Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM ver. 4.0 used in OHDSI. All EHR codes were mapped and converted into the standard vocabulary of the CDM. All data required by the CDM were extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) into the CDM structure.

Epub 2016 Mar 10.,2016/03/13 06:00,Statistics in medicine,"Controversy over non-reproducible published research reporting a statistically significant result has produced substantial discussion in the literature. p-value calibration is a recently proposed procedure for adjusting p-values to account for both random and systematic errors that address one aspect of this problem. The method's validity rests on the key assumption that bias in an effect estimate is drawn from a normal distribution whose mean and variance can be correctly estimated. We investigated the method's control of type I and type II error rates using simulated and real-world data. Under mild violations of underlying assumptions, control of the type I error rate can be conservative, while under more extreme departures, it can be anti-conservative. The extent to which the assumption is violated in real-world data analyses is unknown. Barriers to testing the plausibility of the assumption using historical data are discussed. Our studies of the type II error rate using simulated and real-world electronic health care data demonstrated that calibrating p-values can substantially increase the type II error rate. The use of calibrated p-values may reduce the number of false-positive results, but there will be a commensurate drop in the ability to detect a true safety or efficacy signal. While p-value calibration can sometimes offer advantages in controlling the type I error rate, its adoption for routine use in studies of real-world health care datasets is premature. Separate characterizations of random and systematic errors provide a richer context for evaluating uncertainty surrounding effect estimates.

Multiple databases are often used to increase power, to assess rare exposures or outcomes, or to study diverse populations. For privacy and sociological reasons, original data on individual subjects can't be shared, requiring a distributed network approach where data processing is performed prior to data sharing. CASE DESCRIPTIONS AND VARIATION AMONG SITES: We created a conceptual framework distinguishing three steps in local data processing: (1) data reorganization into a data structure common across the network; (2) derivation of study variables not present in original data; and (3) application of study design to transform longitudinal data into aggregated data sets for statistical analysis. We applied this framework to four case studies to identify similarities and differences in the United States and Europe: Exploring and Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions by Integrative Mining of Clinical Records and Biomedical Knowledge (EU-ADR), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP), the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Mini-Sentinel, and the Italian network-the Integration of Content Management Information on the Territory of Patients with Complex Diseases or with Chronic Conditions (MATRICE). FINDINGS: National networks (OMOP, Mini-Sentinel, MATRICE) all adopted shared procedures for local data reorganization. The multinational EU-ADR network needed locally defined procedures to reorganize its heterogeneous data into a common structure. Derivation of new data elements was centrally defined in all networks but the procedure was not shared in EU-ADR. Application of study design was a common and shared procedure in all the case studies. Computer procedures were embodied in different programming languages, including SAS, R, SQL, Java, and C++. CONCLUSION: Using our conceptual framework we found several areas that would benefit from research to identify optimal standards for production of empirical knowledge from existing databases.an opportunity to advance evidence-based care management. In addition, formalized CM outcomes assessment methodologies will enable us to compare CM effectiveness across health delivery settings.","Data Extraction and Management in Networks of Observational Health Care Databases for Scientific Research: A Comparison of EU-ADR, OMOP, Mini-Sentinel and MATRICE Strategies.",,,

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) represent a rich source of labeled information that can be harnessed for severity classification. The labeling of EHRs is expensive and in many cases requires employing professionals with high level of expertise. In this study, we demonstrate the use of Active Learning (AL) techniques to decrease expert labeling efforts. We employ three AL methods and demonstrate their ability to reduce labeling efforts while effectively discriminating condition severity. We incorporate three AL methods into a new framework based on the original CAESAR (Classification Approach for Extracting Severity Automatically from Electronic Health Records) framework to create the Active Learning Enhancement framework (CAESAR-ALE). We applied CAESAR-ALE to a dataset containing 516 conditions of varying severity levels that were manually labeled by seven experts. Our dataset, called the ""CAESAR dataset,"" was created from the medical records of 1.9 million patients treated at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). All three AL methods decreased labelers' efforts compared to the learning methods applied by the original CAESER framework in which the classifier was trained on the entire set of conditions; depending on the AL strategy used in the current study, the reduction ranged from 48% to 64% that can result in significant savings, both in time and money. As for the PPV (precision) measure, CAESAR-ALE achieved more than 13% absolute improvement in the predictive capabilities of the framework when classifying conditions as severe. These results demonstrate the potential of AL methods to decrease the labeling efforts of medical experts, while increasing accuracy given the same (or even a smaller) number of acquired conditions. We also demonstrated that the methods included in the CAESAR-ALE framework (Exploitation and Combination_XA) are more robust to the use of human labelers with different levels of professional expertise.",Improving condition severity classification with an efficient active learning based framework.,"['Algorithms', 'Automation', '*Data Curation', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Problem-Based Learning']",,

METHOD: In this mixed-method pilot study (2012-2014), 36 faculty in 12 primary care residencies (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics) from four institutions participated in a professional development program designed to prepare faculty to accelerate change in primary care residency training by uniting them in a common mission to create effective ambulatory clinical learning environments. Surveys administered at baseline and 12 months after initial training measured changes in faculty members' confidence and skills, continuity clinics, and residency training programs. Feasibility evaluation involved assessing participation. The authors compared quantitative data using Wilcoxon signed-rank and Bhapkar tests. Observational field notes underwent narrative analysis. RESULTS: Most participants attended two in-person training sessions (92% and 72%, respectively). Between baseline and 12 months, faculty members' confidence in leadership improved significantly for 15/19 (79%) variables assessed; their self-assessed skills improved significantly for 21/22 (95%) competencies. Two medical home domains (""Continuity of Care,"" ""Support/Care Coordination"") improved significantly (P < .05) between the two time periods. Analyses of qualitative data revealed that interdisciplinary learning communities formed during the program and served to catalyze transformational change. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that improvements in faculty perceptions of confidence and skills occurred and that the creation of interdisciplinary learning communities catalyzed transformation. Lengthening the intervention period, engaging other professions involved in training the primary care workforce, and a more discriminating evaluation design are needed to scale this model nationally.","A Model for Catalyzing Educational and Clinical Transformation in Primary Care: Outcomes From a Partnership Among Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics.","['Adult', '*Curriculum', 'Education, Medical, Graduate/*trends', 'Family Practice/*education', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Internal Medicine/*education', '*Interprofessional Relations', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pediatrics/*education', 'Pilot Projects', 'Primary Health Care/*trends', 'Program Evaluation', 'United States']",,

Observational research can test its own clinical hypotheses, and observational studies also can contribute to the design of experiments and inform the generalizability of experimental research. Understanding the diversity of populations and the variance in care is one component. In this study, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaboration created an international data network with 11 data sources from four countries, including electronic health records and administrative claims data on 250 million patients. All data were mapped to common data standards, patient privacy was maintained by using a distributed model, and results were aggregated centrally. Treatment pathways were elucidated for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and depression. The pathways revealed that the world is moving toward more consistent therapy over time across diseases and across locations, but significant heterogeneity remains among sources, pointing to challenges in generalizing clinical trial results. Diabetes favored a single first-line medication, metformin, to a much greater extent than hypertension or depression. About 10% of diabetes and depression patients and almost 25% of hypertension patients followed a treatment pathway that was unique within the cohort. Aside from factors such as sample size and underlying population (academic medical center versus general population), electronic health records data and administrative claims data revealed similar results.

In this review, we focus on Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), a rare Mendelian disease characterized by compound heterozygous mutations in 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) resulting in severe fetal deformities. We present a compilation of SLOS-inducing DHCR7 mutations and the geographic distribution of those mutations in healthy and diseased populations. We observed that several mutations thought to be disease causing occur in healthy populations, indicating an incomplete understanding of the condition and highlighting new research opportunities. We describe the functional environment around DHCR7, including pharmacological DHCR7 inhibitors and cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis. Using PubMed, we investigated the fetal outcomes following prenatal exposure to DHCR7 modulators. First-trimester exposure to DHCR7 inhibitors resulted in outcomes similar to those of known teratogens (50 vs 48% born-healthy). DHCR7 activity should be considered during drug development and prenatal toxicity assessment.",Investigation of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase pathway to elucidate off-target prenatal effects of pharmaceuticals: a systematic review.,"['Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heredity', 'Humans', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Mutation', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome/drug therapy/enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Vitamin D/metabolism']",,

OMOP had applied thousands of designs and design parameters to 53 drug-outcome pairs across 10 electronic data resources. Our intent was to use this repository to elucidate some sources of error in observational studies. METHOD: From the 2010 OMOP Experiment, we sought drug-outcome-method combinations (DOMCs) that met consensus design criteria, yet repeatedly produced results contrary to expectation. We set aside DOMCs for which we could not agree on the suitability of the designs, then selected for an in-depth scrutiny one drug-outcome pair analyzed by a seemingly plausible methodological approach, whose results consistently disagreed with the a priori expectation. RESULTS: The OMOP ""all-by-all"" assessment of possible DOMCs yielded many combinations that would not be chosen by researchers as actual study options. Among those that passed a first level of scrutiny, two of seven drug-outcome pairs for which there were plausible research designs had anomalous results. The use of benzodiazepines was unexpectedly associated with acute renal failure and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. We chose the latter as an example for in-depth study. The factitious appearance of a bleeding risk may have been partly driven by an excess of procedures on the first day of treatment. A risk window definition that excluded the first day largely removed the spurious association. CONCLUSION: One cause of reproducible ""error"" may be repeated failure to tie design choices closely enough to the research question at hand.

AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science,"Prenatal and perinatal exposures vary seasonally (e.g., sunlight, allergens) and many diseases are linked with variance in exposure. Epidemiologists often measure these changes using birth month as a proxy for seasonal variance. Likewise, Genome-Wide Association Studies have associated or implicated these same diseases with many genes. Both disparate data types (epidemiological and genetic) can provide key insights into the underlying disease biology. We developed an algorithm that links 1) epidemiological data from birth month studies with 2) genetic data from published gene-disease association studies. Our framework uses existing data repositories - PubMed, DisGeNET and Gene Ontology - to produce a bipartite network that connects enriched seasonally varying biofactorss with birth month dependent diseases (BMDDs) through their overlapping developmental gene sets. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate 7 known BMDDs and highlight three important biological networks revealed by our algorithm and explore some interesting genetic mechanisms potentially responsible for the seasonal contribution to BMDDs.",In Search of 'Birth Month Genes': Using Existing Data Repositories to Locate Genes Underlying Birth Month-Disease Relationships.,,,

This makes transparent documentation paramount. In this proof-of-concept study, a novel standard data derivation procedure was tested in a set of heterogeneous data sources. Identification of subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was the test case. We included three primary care data sources (PCDs), three record linkage of administrative and/or registry data sources (RLDs), one hospital and one biobank. Overall, data from 12 million subjects from six European countries were extracted. Based on a shared event definition, sixteeen standard algorithms (components) useful to identify T2DM cases were generated through a top-down/bottom-up iterative approach. Each component was based on one single data domain among diagnoses, drugs, diagnostic test utilization and laboratory results. Diagnoses-based components were subclassified considering the healthcare setting (primary, secondary, inpatient care). The Unified Medical Language System was used for semantic harmonization within data domains. Individual components were extracted and proportion of population identified was compared across data sources. Drug-based components performed similarly in RLDs and PCDs, unlike diagnoses-based components. Using components as building blocks, logical combinations with AND, OR, AND NOT were tested and local experts recommended their preferred data source-tailored combination. The population identified per data sources by resulting algorithms varied from 3.5% to 15.7%, however, age-specific results were fairly comparable. The impact of individual components was assessed: diagnoses-based components identified the majority of cases in PCDs (93-100%), while drug-based components were the main contributors in RLDs (81-100%). The proposed data derivation procedure allowed the generation of data source-tailored case-finding algorithms in a standardized fashion, facilitated transparent documentation of the process and benchmarking of data sources, and provided bases for interpretation of possible inter-data source inconsistency of findings in future studies.",Identifying Cases of Type 2 Diabetes in Heterogeneous Data Sources: Strategy from the EMIF Project.,"['Data Mining/*methods', '*Databases, Factual', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male']",,

We describe a case study of converting electronic health data from five skilled nursing facilities to a research quality longitudinal dataset by means of open-source tools produced by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative. METHODS: The Long-Term Care Minimum Data Set (MDS), drug dispensing, and fall incident data from five SNFs were extracted, translated, and loaded into version 4 of the OHDSI common data model. Quality assurance involved identifying errors using the Achilles data characterization tool and comparing both quality measures and drug exposures in the new database for concordance with externally available sources. FINDINGS: Records for a total 4,519 patients (95.1%) made it into the final database. Achilles identified 10 different types of errors that were addressed in the final dataset. Drug exposures based on dispensing were generally accurate when compared with medication administration data from the pharmacy services provider. Quality measures were generally concordant between the new database and Nursing Home Compare for measures with a prevalence >/= 10%. Fall data recorded in MDS was found to be more complete than data from fall incident reports. CONCLUSIONS: The new dataset is ready to support observational research on topics of clinical importance in the nursing home including patient-level prediction of falls.

From the medical records of the general practitioners (GP) who volunteered to participate, cases were extracted by algorithms based on diagnosis codes, keywords, drug prescriptions and results of diagnostic tests. A random sample of identified cases was validated by interviewing their GPs. SETTING: HSD is a database of primary care medical records. A panel of 12 GPs participated in this validation study. PARTICIPANTS: 300 patients were sampled for each disease, except for HF, where 243 patients were assessed. OUTCOME MEASURES: The positive predictive value (PPV) was assessed for the presence/absence of each condition against the GP's response to the questionnaire, and Cohen's kappa was calculated for agreement on the severity level. RESULTS: The PPV was 100% (99% to 100%) for T2DM and hypertension, 98% (96% to 100%) for IHD and 55% (49% to 61%) for HF. Cohen's kappa for agreement on the severity level was 0.70 for T2DM and 0.69 for hypertension and IHD. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that individuals with T2DM, hypertension or IHD can be validly identified in HSD by automated identification algorithms. Automatic queries for levels of severity of the same diseases compare well with the corresponding clinical definitions, but some misclassification occurs. For HF, further research is needed to refine the current algorithm.","Automatic identification of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure and their levels of severity from Italian General Practitioners' electronic medical records: a validation study.","['Algorithms', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Records/*standards', 'Heart Failure/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*diagnosis', 'Italy', 'Myocardial Ischemia/*diagnosis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four CDMs were chosen from models in use for clinical research data: Sentinel v5.0 (referred to as the Mini-Sentinel CDM in previous versions), PCORnet v3.0 (an extension of the Mini-Sentinel CDM), OMOP v5.0, and CDISC SDTM v1.4. Each model was evaluated against 11 criteria adapted from previous research. The criteria fell into six categories: content coverage, integrity, flexibility, ease of querying, standards compatibility, and ease and extent of implementation. RESULTS: The OMOP CDM accommodated the highest percentage of our data elements (76%), fared well on other requirements, and had broader terminology coverage than the other models. Sentinel and PCORnet fell short in content coverage with 37% and 48% matches respectively. Although SDTM accommodated a significant percentage of data elements (55% true matches), 45% of the data elements mapped to SDTM's extension mechanism, known as Supplemental Qualifiers, increasing the number of joins required to query the data. CONCLUSION: The OMOP CDM best met the criteria for supporting data sharing from longitudinal EHR-based studies.

There are different sources of information used in pharmacovigilance to identify, evaluate, and disseminate medical product safety evidence including spontaneous reports, published peer-reviewed literature, and product labels. Automated data processing and classification using these evidence sources can greatly reduce the manual curation currently required to develop reference sets of positive and negative controls (i.e. drugs that cause adverse drug events and those that do not) to be used in drug safety research. METHODS: In this paper we explore a method for automatically aggregating disparate sources of information together into a single repository, developing a predictive model to classify drug-adverse event relationships, and applying those predictions to a real world problem of identifying negative controls for statistical method calibration. RESULTS: Our results showed high predictive accuracy for the models combining all available evidence, with an area under the receiver-operator curve of ⩾0.92 when tested on three manually generated lists of drugs and conditions that are known to either have or not have an association with an adverse drug event. CONCLUSIONS: Results from a pilot implementation of the method suggests that it is feasible to develop a scalable alternative to the time-and-resource-intensive, manual curation exercise previously applied to develop reference sets of positive and negative controls to be used in drug safety research.",Accuracy of an automated knowledge base for identifying drug adverse reactions.,"['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', '*Electronic Data Processing', 'Humans', '*Knowledge Bases', '*Pharmacovigilance']",,

In this regard, there is a need for more research on how to integrate multiple disparate evidence sources while making the evidence computable from a knowledge representation perspective (i.e., semantic enrichment). Existing frameworks suggest well-promising outcomes for such integration but employ a rather limited number of sources. In particular, none have been specifically designed to support both regulatory and clinical use cases, nor have any been designed to add new resources and use cases through an open architecture. This paper discusses the architecture and functionality of a system called Large-scale Adverse Effects Related to Treatment Evidence Standardization (LAERTES) that aims to address these shortcomings. RESULTS: LAERTES provides a standardized, open, and scalable architecture for linking evidence sources relevant to the association of drugs with health outcomes of interest (HOIs). Standard terminologies are used to represent different entities. For example, drugs and HOIs are represented in RxNorm and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms respectively. At the time of this writing, six evidence sources have been loaded into the LAERTES evidence base and are accessible through prototype evidence exploration user interface and a set of Web application programming interface services. This system operates within a larger software stack provided by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics clinical research framework, including the relational Common Data Model for observational patient data created by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership. Elements of the Linked Data paradigm facilitate the systematic and scalable integration of relevant evidence sources. CONCLUSIONS: The prototype LAERTES system provides useful functionality while creating opportunities for further research. Future work will involve improving the method for normalizing drug and HOI concepts across the integrated sources, aggregated evidence at different levels of a hierarchy of HOI concepts, and developing more advanced user interface for drug-HOI investigations.",Large-scale adverse effects related to treatment evidence standardization (LAERTES): an open scalable system for linking pharmacovigilance evidence sources with clinical data.,"['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*standards', 'Humans', '*Pharmacovigilance', 'Reference Standards']",,

Informaticians and domain experts were recruited to design an annotation guideline and generate a training corpus of annotated EC for 230 Alzheimer's clinical trials, which were represented as queries against the OMOP CDM and included 8008 entities, 3550 attributes, and 3529 relations. A sequence labeling-based method was developed for automatic entity and attribute recognition. Negation detection was supported by NegEx and a set of predefined rules. Relation extraction was achieved by a support vector machine classifier. We further performed terminology-based concept normalization and output structuring. RESULTS: In task-specific evaluations, the best F1 score for entity recognition was 0.79, and for relation extraction was 0.89. The accuracy of negation detection was 0.94. The overall accuracy for query formalization was 0.71 in an end-to-end evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents EliIE, an OMOP CDM-based information extraction system for automatic structuring and formalization of free-text EC.

Epub 2017 Apr 27.,2017/05/01 06:00,Artificial intelligence in medicine,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Labeling instances by domain experts for classification is often time consuming and expensive. To reduce such labeling efforts, we had proposed the application of active learning (AL) methods, introduced our CAESAR-ALE framework for classifying the severity of clinical conditions, and shown its significant reduction of labeling efforts. The use of any of three AL methods (one well known [SVM-Margin], and two that we introduced [Exploitation and Combination_XA]) significantly reduced (by 48% to 64%) condition labeling efforts, compared to standard passive (random instance-selection) SVM learning. Furthermore, our new AL methods achieved maximal accuracy using 12% fewer labeled cases than the SVM-Margin AL method. However, because labelers have varying levels of expertise, a major issue associated with learning methods, and AL methods in particular, is how to best to use the labeling provided by a committee of labelers. First, we wanted to know, based on the labelers' learning curves, whether using AL methods (versus standard passive learning methods) has an effect on the Intra-labeler variability (within the learning curve of each labeler) and inter-labeler variability (among the learning curves of different labelers). Then, we wanted to examine the effect of learning (either passively or actively) from the labels created by the majority consensus of a group of labelers. METHODS: We used our CAESAR-ALE framework for classifying the severity of clinical conditions, the three AL methods and the passive learning method, as mentioned above, to induce the classifications models. We used a dataset of 516 clinical conditions and their severity labeling, represented by features aggregated from the medical records of 1.9 million patients treated at Columbia University Medical Center. We analyzed the variance of the classification performance within (intra-labeler), and especially among (inter-labeler) the classification models that were induced by using the labels provided by seven labelers. We also compared the performance of the passive and active learning models when using the consensus label. RESULTS: The AL methods: produced, for the models induced from each labeler, smoother Intra-labeler learning curves during the training phase, compared to the models produced when using the passive learning method. The mean standard deviation of the learning curves of the three AL methods over all labelers (mean: 0.0379; range: [0.0182 to 0.0496]), was significantly lower (p=0.049) than the Intra-labeler standard deviation when using the passive learning method (mean: 0.0484; range: [0.0275-0.0724). Using the AL methods resulted in a lower mean Inter-labeler AUC standard deviation among the AUC values of the labelers' different models during the training phase, compared to the variance of the induced models' AUC values when using passive learning. The Inter-labeler AUC standard deviation, using the passive learning method (0.039), was almost twice as high as the Inter-labeler standard deviation using our two new AL methods (0.02 and 0.019, respectively). The SVM-Margin AL method resulted in an Inter-labeler standard deviation (0.029) that was higher by almost 50% than that of our two AL methods The difference in the inter-labeler standard deviation between the passive learning method and the SVM-Margin learning method was significant (p=0.042). The difference between the SVM-Margin and Exploitation method was insignificant (p=0.29), as was the difference between the Combination_XA and Exploitation methods (p=0.67). Finally, using the consensus label led to a learning curve that had a higher mean intra-labeler variance, but resulted eventually in an AUC that was at least as high as the AUC achieved using the gold standard label and that was always higher than the expected mean AUC of a randomly selected labeler, regardless of the choice of learning method (including a passive learning method). Using a paired t-test, the difference between the intra-labeler AUC standard deviation when using the consensus label, versus that value when using the other two labeling strategies, was significant only when using the passive learning method (p=0.014), but not when using any of the three AL methods. CONCLUSIONS: The use of AL methods, (a) reduces intra-labeler variability in the performance of the induced models during the training phase, and thus reduces the risk of halting the process at a local minimum that is significantly different in performance from the rest of the learned models; and (b) reduces Inter-labeler performance variance, and thus reduces the dependence on the use of a particular labeler. In addition, the use of a consensus label, agreed upon by a rather uneven group of labelers, might be at least as good as using the gold standard labeler, who might not be available, and certainly better than randomly selecting one of the group's individual labelers. Finally, using the AL methods: when provided by the consensus label reduced the intra-labeler AUC variance during the learning phase, compared to using passive learning.",Inter-labeler and intra-labeler variability of condition severity classification models using active and passive learning methods.,"['Area Under Curve', 'Data Mining/*methods', 'Electronic Health Records/*classification', 'Humans', 'Learning Curve', 'Observer Variation', 'Phenotype', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Severity of Illness Index', '*Supervised Machine Learning', 'Time Factors']",,

With phenytoin users (n = 74,682) as a comparator group, propensity score-matching was conducted and hazard ratios computed for angioedema events by per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses. Angioedema events were rare in both the levetiracetam and phenytoin groups (54 vs. 71 in per-protocol and 248 vs. 435 in intent-to-treat). No significant increase in angioedema risk with levetiracetam was seen in any individual database (hazard ratios ranging from 0.43 to 1.31). Meta-analysis showed a summary hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.39-1.31) and 0.64 (95% CI 0.52-0.79) for the per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses, respectively.

However, few studies have examined the potential of these data sources in China. METHODS: Three major types of EHDs in China (i.e., a regional community-based database, a national claims database, and an electronic medical records [EMR] database) were selected for evaluation. Forty core variables were derived based on the US Mini-Sentinel (MS) Common Data Model (CDM) as well as the data features in China that would be desirable to support drug safety surveillance. An email survey of these core variables and eight general questions as well as follow-up inquiries on additional variables was conducted. These 40 core variables across the three EHDs and all variables in each EHD along with those in the US MS CDM and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM were compared for availability and labeled based on specific standards. RESULTS: All of the EHDs' custodians confirmed their willingness to share their databases with academic institutions after appropriate approval was obtained. The regional community-based database contained 1.19 million people in 2015 with 85% of core variables. Resampled annually nationwide, the national claims database included 5.4 million people in 2014 with 55% of core variables, and the EMR database included 3 million inpatients from 60 hospitals in 2015 with 80% of core variables. Compared with MS CDM or OMOP CDM, the proportion of variables across the three EHDs available or able to be transformed/derived from the original sources are 24-83% or 45-73%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These EHDs provide potential value to post-marketing drug safety surveillance and pharmacoepidemiology in China.

Although longitudinal clinical data from Electronic Health Records provides opportunities to develop predictive models, the use of these data faces significant challenges. Primarily, while the data are longitudinal and represent thousands of conceptual events having duration, they are also sparse, complicating the application of traditional analysis approaches. Furthermore, the framework presented here takes advantage of the events duration and gaps. International standards for electronic healthcare data represent data elements, such as procedures, conditions, and drug exposures, using eras, or time intervals. Such eras contain both an event and a duration and enable the application of time intervals mining - a relatively new subfield of data mining. In this study, we present Maitreya, a framework for time intervals analytics in longitudinal clinical data. Maitreya discovers frequent time intervals related patterns (TIRPs), which we use as prognostic markers for modelling clinical events. We introduce three novel TIRP metrics that are normalized versions of the horizontal-support, that represents the number of TIRP instances per patient. We evaluate Maitreya on 28 frequent and clinically important procedures, using the three novel TIRP representation metrics in comparison to no temporal representation and previous TIRPs metrics. We also evaluate the epsilon value that makes Allen's relations more flexible with several settings of 30, 60, 90 and 180days in comparison to the default zero. For twenty-two of these procedures, the use of temporal patterns as predictors was superior to non-temporal features, and the use of the vertically normalized horizontal support metric to represent TIRPs as features was most effective. The use of the epsilon value with thirty days was slightly better than the zero.",Procedure prediction from symbolic Electronic Health Records via time intervals analytics.,"['Algorithms', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Time and Motion Studies']",,

The expertise and scalable solutions needed to transform data to conform to network requirements are beyond the scope of many health care organizations and there is a need for practical tools that lower the barriers of data contribution to clinical research networks. METHODS: We designed and implemented a health data transformation and loading approach, which we refer to as Dynamic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) (D-ETL), that automates part of the process through use of scalable, reusable and customizable code, while retaining manual aspects of the process that requires knowledge of complex coding syntax. This approach provides the flexibility required for the ETL of heterogeneous data, variations in semantic expertise, and transparency of transformation logic that are essential to implement ETL conventions across clinical research sharing networks. Processing workflows are directed by the ETL specifications guideline, developed by ETL designers with extensive knowledge of the structure and semantics of health data (i.e., ""health data domain experts"") and target common data model. RESULTS: D-ETL was implemented to perform ETL operations that load data from various sources with different database schema structures into the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) common data model. The results showed that ETL rule composition methods and the D-ETL engine offer a scalable solution for health data transformation via automatic query generation to harmonize source datasets. CONCLUSIONS: D-ETL supports a flexible and transparent process to transform and load health data into a target data model. This approach offers a solution that lowers technical barriers that prevent data partners from participating in research data networks, and therefore, promotes the advancement of comparative effectiveness research using secondary electronic health data.","Dynamic-ETL: a hybrid approach for health data extraction, transformation and loading.","['Biomedical Research', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Data Mining/methods/*standards', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records/*standards', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical']",,

We seek to uncover distal risk factors underlying these relationships by probing the relationship between global exposure variance and disease risk variance by birth season. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study utilizes electronic health record data from 6 sites representing 10.5 million individuals in 3 countries (United States, South Korea, and Taiwan). We obtained birth month-disease risk curves from each site in a case-control manner. Next, we correlated each birth month-disease risk curve with each exposure. A meta-analysis was then performed of correlations across sites. This allowed us to identify the most significant birth month-exposure relationships supported by all 6 sites while adjusting for multiplicity. We also successfully distinguish relative age effects (a cultural effect) from environmental exposures. RESULTS: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was the only identified relative age association. Our methods identified several culprit exposures that correspond well with the literature in the field. These include a link between first-trimester exposure to carbon monoxide and increased risk of depressive disorder (R = 0.725, confidence interval [95% CI], 0.529-0.847), first-trimester exposure to fine air particulates and increased risk of atrial fibrillation (R = 0.564, 95% CI, 0.363-0.715), and decreased exposure to sunlight during the third trimester and increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (R = -0.816, 95% CI, -0.5767, -0.929).

We also reviewed the Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource standard supporting app-like programs that can be used across multiple EHR and research systems. Results: There has been a recent growth in high-impact efforts to support quality-assured and standardized clinical data sharing across different institutions and EHR systems. We focused on three major efforts as part of a larger landscape moving towards shareable, transportable, and computable clinical data. Conclusion: The growth in approaches to developing common data models to support interoperable knowledge representation portends an increasing availability of high-quality clinical data in support of research.

A previous ecological study demonstrated that compliance with standards of care could be reliably estimated on regional level using administrative databases. This study compares estimates based on administrative data with estimates based on GP records for the same persons, to understand whether ecological fallacy played a role in the results of the previous study. METHODS: We compared estimates of compliance with diagnostic and therapeutic standards of care for type 2 diabetes (T2DM), hypertension and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) from administrative data (IAD) with estimates from medical records (MR) for the same persons registered with 24 GP's in 2012. Data were linked at an individual level. RESULTS: 32,688 persons entered the study, 12,673 having at least one of the three diseases according to at least one data source. Patients not detected by IAD were many, for all three conditions: adding MR increased the number of cases of T2DM, hypertension, and IHD by +40%, +42%, and +104%, respectively. IAD had imperfect sensitivity in detecting population compliance with therapies (adding MR increased the estimate, from +11.5% for statins to +14.7% for antithrombotics), and, more substantially, with diagnostic recommendations (adding MR increased the estimate, from +23.7% in glycated hemoglobin tests, to +50.5% in electrocardiogram). Patients not detected by IAD were less compliant with respect to those that IAD correctly identified (from -4.8 percentage points in proportion of IHD patients compliant with a yearly glycated hemoglobin test, to -40.1 points in the proportion of T2DM patients compliant with the same recommendation). IAD overestimated indicators of compliance with therapeutic standards (significant differences ranged from 3.3. to 3.6 percentage points) and underestimated indicators of compliance with diagnostic standards (significant differences ranged from -2.3 to -14.1 percentage points). CONCLUSION: IAD overestimated the percentage of patients compliant with therapeutic standards by less than 6 percentage points, and underestimated the percentage of patients compliant with diagnostic standards by a maximum of 14 percentage points. Therefore, both discussions at local level between GP's and local health unit managers and discussions at central level between national and regional policy makers can be informed by indicators of compliance estimated by IAD, which, based on those results, have the ability of signalling critical or excellent clusters. However, this study found that estimates are partly flawed, because a high number of patients with chronic diseases are not detected by IAD, patients detected are not representative of the whole population of patients, and some categories of diagnostic tests are markedly underrecorded in IAD (up to 50% in the case of electrocardiograms). Those results call to caution when interpreting IAD estimates. Audits based on medical records, on the local level, and an interpretation taking into account information external to IAD, on the central level, are needed to assess a more comprehensive compliance with standards.",Monitoring compliance with standards of care for chronic diseases using healthcare administrative databases in Italy: Strengths and limitations.,"['Chronic Disease/*therapy', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/therapy', 'Female', '*Guideline Adherence', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/therapy', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Myocardial Ischemia/therapy']",,

The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model and the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tools could be used as a core element in this initiative for harmonizing the terminologies used as well as facilitating the federation of research analyses across institutions. OBJECTIVE: To realize an OMOP/OHDSI-based pilot implementation within a consortium of eight German university hospitals, evaluate the applicability to support data harmonization and sharing among them, and identify potential enhancement requirements. METHODS: The vocabularies and terminological mapping required for importing the fact data were prepared, and the process for importing the data from the source files was designed. For eight German university hospitals, a virtual machine preconfigured with the OMOP database and the OHDSI tools as well as the jobs to import the data and conduct the analysis was provided. Last, a federated/distributed query to test the approach was executed. RESULTS: While the mapping of ICD-10 German Modification succeeded with a rate of 98.8% of all terms for diagnoses, the procedures could not be mapped and hence an extension to the OMOP standard terminologies had to be made.Overall, the data of 3 million inpatients with approximately 26 million conditions, 21 million procedures, and 23 million observations have been imported.A federated query to identify a cohort of colorectal cancer patients was successfully executed and yielded 16,701 patient cases visualized in a Sunburst plot.

However, direct measures of gestational age are generally not available. Establishing a reliable approach to infer the duration and outcome of a pregnancy could improve pharmacovigilance activities. We developed and applied an algorithm to define pregnancy episodes in four observational databases: three US-based claims databases: Truven MarketScan(R) Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE), Truven MarketScan(R) Multi-state Medicaid (MDCD), and the Optum ClinFormatics(R) (Optum) database and one non-US database, the United Kingdom (UK) based Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Pregnancy outcomes were classified as live births, stillbirths, abortions and ectopic pregnancies. Start dates were estimated using a derived hierarchy of available pregnancy markers, including records such as last menstrual period and nuchal ultrasound dates. Validation included clinical adjudication of 700 electronic Optum and CPRD pregnancy episode profiles to assess the operating characteristics of the algorithm, and a comparison of the algorithm's Optum pregnancy start estimates to starts based on dates of assisted conception procedures. Distributions of pregnancy outcome types were similar across all four data sources and pregnancy episode lengths found were as expected for all outcomes, excepting term lengths in episodes that used amenorrhea and urine pregnancy tests for start estimation. Validation survey results found highest agreement between reviewer chosen and algorithm operating characteristics for questions assessing pregnancy status and accuracy of outcome category with 99-100% agreement for Optum and CPRD. Outcome date agreement within seven days in either direction ranged from 95-100%, while start date agreement within seven days in either direction ranged from 90-97%. In Optum validation sensitivity analysis, a total of 73% of algorithm estimated starts for live births were in agreement with fertility procedure estimated starts within two weeks in either direction; ectopic pregnancy 77%, stillbirth 47%, and abortion 36%. An algorithm to infer live birth and ectopic pregnancy episodes and outcomes can be applied to multiple observational databases with acceptable accuracy for further epidemiologic research. Less accuracy was found for start date estimations in stillbirth and abortion outcomes in our sensitivity analysis, which may be expected given the nature of the outcomes.",Inferring pregnancy episodes and outcomes within a network of observational databases.,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', '*Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Outcome', 'United Kingdom', 'Young Adult']",,

Large-scale prospective cohort studies are needed to explore the relationships between potential risk factors and respiratory disease outcomes and to observe disease prognoses through long-term follow-ups. We aimed to develop a common data model (CDM) for cohort studies on respiratory diseases, in order to harmonize and facilitate the exchange, pooling, sharing, and storing of data from multiple sources to serve the purpose of reusing or uniforming those follow-up data appeared in the cohorts. Methods: The process of developing this CDM of respiratory diseases would follow the steps as: 1 in circleReviewing the international standards, including the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC), Clinical Data Acquisition Standards Harmonization (CDASH) and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM; 2 in circleSummarizing four cohort studies of respiratory diseases recruited in this research and assessing the data availability; 3 in circleDeveloping a CDM related to respiratory diseases. Results: Data on recruited cohorts shared a few similar domains but with various schema. The cohorts also shared homogeneous data collection purposes for future follow-up studies, making the harmonization of current and future data feasible. The derived CDM would include two parts: 1 in circlethirteen common domains for all the four cohorts and derived variables from disparate questions with a common schema, 2 in circleadditional domains designed upon disease-specific research needs, as well as additional variables that were disease-specific but not initially included in the common domains. Conclusion: Data harmonization appeared essential for sharing, comparing and pooled analyses, both retrospectively and prospectively. CDM was needed to convert heterogeneous data from multiple studies into one harmonized dataset.

Observational studies have often been found to be nonreproducible, however, generating conflicting results even when using the same database to answer the same question. One source of discrepancies is error, both random caused by sampling variability and systematic (for example, because of confounding, selection bias, and measurement error). Only random error is typically quantified but converges to zero as databases become larger, whereas systematic error persists independent from sample size and therefore, increases in relative importance. Negative controls are exposure-outcome pairs, where one believes no causal effect exists; they can be used to detect multiple sources of systematic error, but interpreting their results is not always straightforward. Previously, we have shown that an empirical null distribution can be derived from a sample of negative controls and used to calibrate P values, accounting for both random and systematic error. Here, we extend this work to calibration of confidence intervals (CIs). CIs require positive controls, which we synthesize by modifying negative controls. We show that our CI calibration restores nominal characteristics, such as 95% coverage of the true effect size by the 95% CI. We furthermore show that CI calibration reduces disagreement in replications of two pairs of conflicting observational studies: one related to dabigatran, warfarin, and gastrointestinal bleeding and one related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

METHODS: Based on existing best practices we propose a 5 step standardized framework for: (1) transparently defining the problem; (2) selecting suitable datasets; (3) constructing variables from the observational data; (4) learning the predictive model; and (5) validating the model performance. We implemented this framework as open-source software utilizing the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model to enable convenient sharing of models and reproduction of model evaluation across multiple observational datasets. The software implementation contains default covariates and classifiers but the framework enables customization and extension. RESULTS: As a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the transparency and ease of model dissemination using the software, we developed prediction models for 21 different outcomes within a target population of people suffering from depression across 4 observational databases. All 84 models are available in an accessible online repository to be implemented by anyone with access to an observational database in the Common Data Model format.

Our aim is to report on outcomes and prognostic variables following stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for OP and oligometastases (OM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall (OS) and progression-free survivals (PFS) were calculated for 163 patients for 209 lesions (106 OM and 57 OP) treated with SBRT over 9 years. OS and PFS comparisons were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier actuarial survival and log rank methods. Uni, multi-variate analyses and cumulative incidences of local failure were performed using the Cox modelling and Gray's test respectively. RESULTS: The median OS and PFS was 37 and 15 months versus 21.7 and 6.4 months in the OM and OP groups respectively (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01). Performance status (⩾2 HR 2.95) and number of metastases (1/2 vs ⩾3 HR 1.88) were independent prognosticators for survival. The 1/2-year PFS were 55%/25% versus 22%/6% in the OM and OP cohorts. Patterns of first relapse were four times higher outside the irradiated field and OP status (p = 0.03), ⩾3 metastasis (p = 0.002) and concurrent systemic therapy (p = 0.001) conferred a greater risk. Time to second-line treatment was 20 vs 11 months in the OM and OP groups (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Survival and distant relapse following SBRT to OM/OP is determined by the extent of metastatic disease and performance status.

A major data source for PhV is large-scale longitudinal observational databases (LODs) [6] such as electronic health records (EHRs) and medical insurance claim databases. Inspired by the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) model [27], arguably the leading method for ADE discovery from LODs, we propose baseline regularization, a regularized generalized linear model that leverages the diverse health profiles available in LODs across different individuals at different times. We apply the proposed method as well as SCCS to the Marshfield Clinic EHR. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method outperforms SCCS under various settings in identifying benchmark ADEs from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership ground truth [26].",Pharmacovigilance via Baseline Regularization with Large-Scale Longitudinal Observational Data.,,,

Use of common data models (CDM) is the predominant approach in order to enable large scale systematic analyses on disparate data models and vocabularies. Current CDM transformation practices depend on proprietarily developed Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) procedures, which require knowledge both on the semantics and technical characteristics of the source datasets and target CDM. Purpose: In this study, our aim is to develop a modular but coordinated transformation approach in order to separate semantic and technical steps of transformation processes, which do not have a strict separation in traditional ETL approaches. Such an approach would discretize the operations to extract data from source electronic health record systems, alignment of the source, and target models on the semantic level and the operations to populate target common data repositories. Approach: In order to separate the activities that are required to transform heterogeneous data sources to a target CDM, we introduce a semantic transformation approach composed of three steps: (1) transformation of source datasets to Resource Description Framework (RDF) format, (2) application of semantic conversion rules to get the data as instances of ontological model of the target CDM, and (3) population of repositories, which comply with the specifications of the CDM, by processing the RDF instances from step 2. The proposed approach has been implemented on real healthcare settings where Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM has been chosen as the common data model and a comprehensive comparative analysis between the native and transformed data has been conducted. Results: Health records of ~1 million patients have been successfully transformed to an OMOP CDM based database from the source database. Descriptive statistics obtained from the source and target databases present analogous and consistent results. Discussion and Conclusion: Our method goes beyond the traditional ETL approaches by being more declarative and rigorous. Declarative because the use of RDF based mapping rules makes each mapping more transparent and understandable to humans while retaining logic-based computability. Rigorous because the mappings would be based on computer readable semantics which are amenable to validation through logic-based inference methods.",A Semantic Transformation Methodology for the Secondary Use of Observational Healthcare Data in Postmarketing Safety Studies.,,,

But when common data models are used as lenses through which reality is observed from the perspective according to which they are built, then they exhibit restrictions that distort such view. Realism-based ontology design, when done properly, does not have these limitations as its fitness for purpose is only determined by the degree to which reality is represented the way it is. Therefore, we can use the principles that realism-based ontologies adhere to, not only to design application ontologies serving some specific purpose, but also to assess whether and where common data models fall short in their representational adequacy and how they can be corrected. If a realism based ontological perspective on the portion of reality the some common data model is trying to represent is compared with the perspective of the common data model itself, it is possible to determine how the latter deviates from the former and to suggest solutions to correct the misrepresentations found. Applying this method to the common data model of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership, revealed two major categories of errors: one where relationships are restricted based on the constraints of the data model, and one where the representation of reality is oversimplified.",Improving the 'Fitness for Purpose' of Common Data Models through Realism Based Ontology.,"['Big Data', '*Biological Ontologies', '*Common Data Elements', '*Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records/*organization & administration', 'Information Storage and Retrieval']",,

RESULTS: Participating organizations provided 11,026 DQ checks, of which 99.97 percent were successfully mapped to a DQA category. Of the mapped DQ checks (N=11,023), 214 (1.94 percent) mapped to multiple DQA categories. The majority of DQ checks mapped to Atemporal Plausibility (49.60 percent), Value Conformance (17.84 percent), and Atemporal Completeness (12.98 percent) categories. DISCUSSION: Using the common DQA terminology, near-complete (99.97 percent) coverage across a wide range of DQA programs and specifications was reached. Comparing the distributions of mapped DQ checks revealed important differences between participating organizations. This variation may be related to the organization's stakeholder requirements, primary analytical focus, or maturity of their DQA program. Not within scope, mapping checks within the data validation context of the terminology may provide additional insights into DQA practice differences. CONCLUSION: A common DQA terminology provides a means to help organizations and researchers understand the coverage of their current DQA efforts as well as highlight potential areas for additional DQA development. Sharing DQ checks between organizations could help expand the scope of DQA across clinical data networks.",A Comparison of Data Quality Assessment Checks in Six Data Sharing Networks.,,,

However, EHRs may not contain all important data elements for clinical research eligibility screening. To better design research-friendly EHRs, an important step is to identify data elements frequently used for eligibility screening but not yet available in EHRs. This study fills this knowledge gap. Using the Alzheimer's disease domain as an example, we performed text mining on the eligibility criteria text in Clinicaltrials.gov to identify frequently used eligibility criteria concepts. We compared them to the EHR data elements of a cohort of Alzheimer's Disease patients to assess the data gap by usingthe OMOP Common Data Model to standardize the representations for both criteria concepts and EHR data elements. We identified the most common SNOMED CT concepts used in Alzheimer 's Disease trials, andfound 40% of common eligibility criteria concepts were not even defined in the concept space in the EHR dataset for a cohort of Alzheimer 'sDisease patients, indicating a significant data gap may impede EHR-based eligibility screening. The results of this study can be useful for designing targeted research data collection forms to help fill the data gap in the EHR.",The Data Gap in the EHR for Clinical Research Eligibility Screening.,,,

METHODS: Using  approximately 80 million concept-relationship-concept triples extracted from the literature using the SemRep Natural Language Processing system, distributed vector representations (embeddings) were generated for concepts as functions of their relationships utilizing two unsupervised representational approaches. Embeddings for drugs and side effects of interest from two widely used reference standards were then composed to generate embeddings of drug/side-effect pairs, which were used as input for supervised machine learning. This methodology was developed and evaluated using cross-validation strategies and compared to contemporary approaches. To qualitatively assess generalization, models trained on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) drug/side-effect reference set were evaluated against a list of  approximately 1100 drugs from an online database. RESULTS: The employed method improved performance over previous approaches. Cross-validation results advance the state of the art (AUC 0.96; F1 0.90 and AUC 0.95; F1 0.84 across the two sets), outperforming methods utilizing literature and/or spontaneous reporting system data. Examination of predictions for unseen drug/side-effect pairs indicates the ability of these methods to generalize, with over tenfold label support enrichment in the top 100 predictions versus the bottom 100 predictions.

Similar to other large international data sharing networks (e.g. OHDSI, PCORnet, eMerge, RD-Connect) MIRACUM is a consortium of academic and hospital partners as well as one industrial partner in eight German cities which have joined forces to create interoperable data integration centres (DIC) and make data within those DIC available for innovative new IT solutions in patient care and medical research. OBJECTIVES: Sharing data shall be supported by common interoperable tools and services, in order to leverage the power of such data for biomedical discovery and moving towards a learning health system. This paper aims at illustrating the major building blocks and concepts which MIRACUM will apply to achieve this goal. GOVERNANCE AND POLICIES: Besides establishing an efficient governance structure within the MIRACUM consortium (based on the steering board, a central administrative office, the general MIRACUM assembly, six working groups and the international scientific advisory board), defining DIC governance rules and data sharing policies, as well as establishing (at each MIRACUM DIC site, but also for MIRACUM in total) use and access committees are major building blocks for the success of such an endeavor. ARCHITECTURAL FRAMEWORK AND METHODOLOGY: The MIRACUM DIC architecture builds on a comprehensive ecosystem of reusable open source tools (MIRACOLIX), which are linkable and interoperable amongst each other, but also with the existing software environment of the MIRACUM hospitals. Efficient data protection measures, considering patient consent, data harmonization and a MIRACUM metadata repository as well as a common data model are major pillars of this framework. The methodological approach for shared data usage relies on a federated querying and analysis concept. USE CASES: MIRACUM aims at proving the value of their DIC with three use cases: IT support for patient recruitment into clinical trials, the development and routine care implementation of a clinico-molecular predictive knowledge tool, and molecular-guided therapy recommendations in molecular tumor boards. RESULTS: Based on the MIRACUM DIC release in the nine months conceptual phase first large scale analysis for stroke and colorectal cancer cohorts have been pursued. DISCUSSION: Beyond all technological challenges successfully applying the MIRACUM tools for the enrichment of our knowledge about diagnostic and therapeutic concepts, thus supporting the concept of a Learning Health System will be crucial for the acceptance and sustainability in the medical community and the MIRACUM university hospitals.",MIRACUM: Medical Informatics in Research and Care in University Medicine.,"['*Biomedical Research', 'Clinical Governance', '*Delivery of Health Care', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', '*Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination', '*Medical Informatics', 'Patient Selection', 'Policy', 'Search Engine']",,

Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences","Concerns over reproducibility in science extend to research using existing healthcare data; many observational studies investigating the same topic produce conflicting results, even when using the same data. To address this problem, we propose a paradigm shift. The current paradigm centres on generating one estimate at a time using a unique study design with unknown reliability and publishing (or not) one estimate at a time. The new paradigm advocates for high-throughput observational studies using consistent and standardized methods, allowing evaluation, calibration and unbiased dissemination to generate a more reliable and complete evidence base. We demonstrate this new paradigm by comparing all depression treatments for a set of outcomes, producing 17 718 hazard ratios, each using methodology on par with current best practice. We furthermore include control hypotheses to evaluate and calibrate our evidence generation process. Results show good transitivity and consistency between databases, and agree with four out of the five findings from clinical trials. The distribution of effect size estimates reported in the literature reveals an absence of small or null effects, with a sharp cut-off at p = 0.05. No such phenomena were observed in our results, suggesting more complete and more reliable evidence.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The growing ubiquity of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations'.",Improving reproducibility by using high-throughput observational studies with empirical calibration.,,,

The healthcare research ecosystem would benefit if tools and projects could be adopted independently from the underlying data model. Here, we introduce the concept of a reusable application programming interface (API) for healthcare and show that the i2b2 API can be adapted to support diverse patient-centric data models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop methodology for extending i2b2's pre-existing API to query additional data models, using i2b2's recent ""multi-fact-table querying"" feature. Our method involves developing data-model-specific i2b2 ontologies and mapping these to query non-standard table structure. RESULTS: We implement this methodology to query OMOP and PCORnet models, which we validate with the i2b2 query tool. We implement the entire PCORnet data model and a five-domain subset of the OMOP model. We also demonstrate that additional, ancillary data model columns can be modeled and queried as i2b2 ""modifiers."" DISCUSSION: i2b2's REST API can be used to query multiple healthcare data models, enabling shared tooling to have a choice of backend data stores. This enables separation between data model and software tooling for some of the more popular open analytic data models in healthcare.

RESULTS: We completed and documented the process for the CDM conversion. The coordinating center and participating sites reviewed the documents and refined the conversions based on the comments. The time required to convert data to the CDM varied widely across sites and included conversion to standard terminology codes and refinements of the conversion based on reviews. We mapped 97.2%, 86.7%, 92.6%, and 80.1% of domestic drug codes from the USA, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Korea to RxNorm, respectively. The mapping rate from Japanese domestic drug codes to RxNorm (70.7%) was lower than from other countries, and we mapped remaining unmapped drugs to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System codes. Because the native databases used international procedure coding systems for which mapping tables have been established, we were able to map >90% of diagnosis and procedure codes to standard terminology codes. CONCLUSION: The CDM established the foundation and reinforced collaboration for multinational pharmacoepidemiologic studies in Asia.

We systematically examined the effect of methodological variations ((i) time series construction, (ii) temporal parameterization, (iii) intra-subject normalization, (iv) differencing (lagged rates of change achieved by taking differences between consecutive measurements), (v) explanatory variables, and (vi) regression models) on performance of lagged linear methods in this context. We generated two gold standards (one knowledge-base derived, one expert-curated) for expected pairwise relationships between 7 drugs and 4 labs, and evaluated how the 64 unique combinations of methodological perturbations reproduce the gold standards. Our 28 cohorts included patients in the Columbia University Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital clinical database, and ranged from 2820 to 79,514 patients with between 8 and 209 average time points per patient. The most accurate methods achieved AUROC of 0.794 for knowledge-base derived gold standard (95%CI [0.741, 0.847]) and 0.705 for expert-curated gold standard (95% CI [0.629, 0.781]). We observed a mean AUROC of 0.633 (95%CI [0.610, 0.657], expert-curated gold standard) across all methods that re-parameterize time according to sequence and use either a joint autoregressive model with time-series differencing or an independent lag model without differencing. The complement of this set of methods achieved a mean AUROC close to 0.5, indicating the importance of these choices. We conclude that time-series analysis of EHR data will likely rely on some of the beneficial pre-processing and modeling methodologies identified, and will certainly benefit from continued careful analysis of methodological perturbations.

DISCUSSION: The translation of data from source vocabularies to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) resulted in very small error rates that were an order of magnitude smaller than other error sources. CONCLUSION: It appears possible to map diagnoses from disparate vocabularies to a single clinical vocabulary and carry out research using a single set of definitions, thus improving efficiency and transportability of research.",Effect of vocabulary mapping for conditions on phenotype cohorts.,"['Humans', '*International Classification of Diseases', 'Observational Studies as Topic', '*Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Vocabulary, Controlled']",,

study of drugs in China. In order to run the ""Treatment Pathways in Chronic Disease"" protocol in Chinese data sources,we have built a large data research and analysis platform for Chinese clinical medical data. Data sourced from the Clinical Data Repository (CDR) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University was extracted, transformed, and loaded into an observational medical outcomes partnership common data model (OMOP CDM) Ver. 5.0. Diagnosis and medication information for patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and depression from 2005 to 2015 were extracted for observational research to obtain treatment pathways for the three diseases. The most common medications used to treat diabetes and hypertension were metformin and acarbose, respectively, at 28.5 and 20.9% as first-line medication. New drugs were emerging for depression; therefore, the favorite medication changed accordingly. Most patients with these three diseases had different treatment pathways from other patients with the same diseases. The proportions of monotherapy increased for the three diseases, especially in recent years. The recommendations presented in guidelines show some predominance. High-quality, effective guidelines incorporating domestic facts should be established to further guide medication and improve therapy at local hospitals. Medical institutions at all levels could improve the quality of medical services, and further standardize medications in the future. This research is the first application of the CDM model and OHDSI software in China, which were used to study, treatment pathways for three chronic diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes and depression), compare the pathways with recommendations from guidelines, discuss differences and standardization of medications in different medical institutions, demonstrate the urgent need for quality national guidelines, explores population diversification and changes of clinical treatment, and provide clinical big data analysis-based data support for the development and study of drugs in China.",Analysis of treatment pathways for three chronic diseases using OMOP CDM.,"['China', 'Chronic Disease/*drug therapy', '*Critical Pathways', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Observation']",,

The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Common Data Model (CDM) organizes healthcare data into standard data structures using concepts that are explicitly and formally specified through standard vocabularies, thereby facilitating large-scale analysis. The objective of this study is to design, develop, and evaluate generic survival analysis routines built using the OHDSI CDM. METHODS: We used intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patient data to implement CDM-based survival analysis methods. Our methods comprise the following modules: 1) Mapping local terms to standard OHDSI concepts. The analytical expression of variables and values related to demographic characteristics, medical history, smoking status, laboratory results, and tumor feature data. These data were mapped to standard OHDSI concepts through a manual analysis; 2) Loading patient data into the CDM using the concept mappings; 3) Developing an R interface that supports the portable survival analysis on top of OHDSI CDM, and comparing the CDM-based analysis results with those using traditional statistical analysis methods. RESULTS: Our dataset contained 346 patients diagnosed with ICC. The collected clinical data contains 115 variables, of which 75 variables were mapped to the OHDSI concepts. These concepts mainly belong to four domains: condition, observation, measurement, and procedure. The corresponding standard concepts are scattered in six vocabularies: ICD10CM, ICD10PCS, SNOMED, LOINC, NDFRT, and READ. We loaded a total of 25,950 patient data records into the OHDSI CDM database. However, 40 variables failed to map to the OHDSI CDM as they mostly belong to imaging data and pathological data. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that conducting survival analysis using the OHDSI CDM is feasible and can produce reusable analysis routines. However, challenges to be overcome include 1) semantic loss caused by inaccurate mapping and value normalization; 2) incomplete OHDSI vocabularies describing imaging data, pathological data, and modular data representation.",Preliminary exploration of survival analysis using the OHDSI common data model: a case study of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,"['*Big Data', '*Cholangiocarcinoma', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Information Storage and Retrieval', '*Information Systems', '*Survival Analysis']",,

Many of them are treated with antidiabetics. As the basis of the studies on the benefit and harm of antidiabetic drugs in the region, the information on patterns of market penetration of new classes of antidiabetic medications is important in providing context for subsequent research and analyzing and interpreting results. METHODS: We compared penetration patterns of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States. We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, a random sample of the Hong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System, the Japan Medical Data Center database, and a 5% random sample of the US Medicare database converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership's Common Data Model to identify new users of oral antidiabetic medications. We standardized prevalence and incidence rates of medication use by age and sex to those in the 2010 Taiwanese population. We compared age, sex, comorbid conditions, and concurrent medications between new users of DPP-4 inhibitors and biguanides. RESULTS: Use of DPP-4 inhibitors 1 year after market entry was highest in Japan and lowest in Hong Kong. New users had more heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and renal failure than biguanide users in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States while the proportions were similar in Japan. In a country with low penetration of DPP-4 inhibitors (eg, Hong Kong), users had diabetes with multiple comorbid conditions compared with biguanidine users. In a country with high penetration (eg, Japan), the proportion of users with comorbid conditions was similar to that of biguanide users. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a marked difference of the penetration patterns of newly marketed antidiabetics in different countries in Asia.

The availability of electronic medical records and insurance claims data, which capture routine medical practice, accessed via the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network presents an opportunity to generate evidence for the effectiveness of second-line treatments. OBJECTIVE: To identify which drug classes among sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones are associated with reduced hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and lower risk of myocardial infarction, kidney disorders, and eye disorders in patients with T2D treated with metformin as a first-line therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Three retrospective, propensity-matched, new-user cohort studies with replication across 8 sites were performed from 1975 to 2017. Medical data of 246 558 805 patients from multiple countries from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative were included and medical data sets were transformed into a unified common data model, with analysis done using open-source analytical tools. Participants included patients with T2D receiving metformin with at least 1 prior HbA1c laboratory test who were then prescribed either sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones. Data analysis was conducted from 2015 to 2018. EXPOSURES: Treatment with sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones starting at least 90 days after the initial prescription of metformin. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome is the first observation of the reduction of HbA1c level to 7% of total hemoglobin or less after prescription of a second-line drug. Secondary outcomes are myocardial infarction, kidney disorder, and eye disorder after prescription of a second-line drug. RESULTS: A total of 246 558 805 patients (126 977 785 women [51.5%]) were analyzed. Effectiveness of sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones prescribed after metformin to lower HbA1c level to 7% or less of total hemoglobin remained indistinguishable in patients with T2D. Patients treated with sulfonylureas compared with DPP-4 inhibitors had a small increased consensus hazard ratio of myocardial infarction (1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-1.24) and eye disorders (1.15; 95% CI, 1.11-1.19) in the meta-analysis. Hazard of observing kidney disorders after treatment with sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or thiazolidinediones was equally likely. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The examined drug classes did not differ in lowering HbA1c and in hazards of kidney disorders in patients with T2D treated with metformin as a first-line therapy. Sulfonylureas had a small, higher observed hazard of myocardial infarction and eye disorders compared with DPP-4 inhibitors in the meta-analysis.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in pregnancy is up to 10-fold higher in Indigenous than non-Indigenous Australian mothers, and the use of metformin is common. We assessed birth outcomes in relation to metformin use during pregnancy from a clinical register. METHODS: The study included women with gestational diabetes (GDM), newly diagnosed diabetes in pregnancy (DIP), or pre-existing T2D from 2012 to 2016. Data were analyzed for metformin use in the third trimester. Regression models were adjusted for maternal age, body mass index, parity, and insulin use. RESULTS: Of 1649 pregnancies, 814 (49.4%) were to Indigenous women, of whom 234 (28.7%) had T2D (vs 4.6% non-Indigenous women; P < 0.001). Metformin use was high in Indigenous women (84%-90% T2D, 42%-48% GDM/DIP) and increased over time in non-Indigenous women (43%-100% T2D, 14%-35% GDM/DIP). Among Indigenous women with GDM/DIP, there were no significant differences between groups with and without metformin in cesarean section (51% vs 39%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.81), large for gestational age (24% vs 13%; aOR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.5), or serious neonatal adverse events (9.4% vs 5.9%; aOR 1.32, 95% CI 0.68-2.57). Metformin use was independently associated with earlier gestational age (37.7 vs 38.5 weeks), but the risk did not remain independently higher after exclusion of women managed with medical nutrition therapy alone, and the increase in births <37 weeks was not significant on multivariate analysis.

It can expand the reach of primary care and public health service provision in underserviced rural communities through proactive engagement of paramedics in preventative care and chronic disease management. This study addressed key research priorities identified at the National Agenda for Community Paramedicine Research conference in Atlanta, USA in 2012. The motivations, job satisfaction and challenges from the perspectives of community paramedics and their managers pioneering two independent programs in rural North America were identified. METHODS: An observational ethnographic approach was used to acquire qualitative data from participants, through informal discussions, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and direct observation of practice. During field trips over two summers, researchers purposively recruited participants from Ontario, Canada and Colorado, USA. These sites were selected on the basis of uncomplicated facilitation of ethics and institutional approval, the diversity of the programs and willingness of service managers to welcome researchers. Thematic analysis techniques were adopted for transcribing, de-identifying and coding data that allowed identification of common themes. RESULTS: This study highlighted that the innovative nature of the community paramedic role can leave practitioners feeling misunderstood and unsupported by their peers. Three themes emerged: the motivators driving participation, the transitional challenges facing practitioners and the characteristics of paramedics engaged in these roles. A major motivator is the growing use of ambulances for non-emergency calls and the associated need to develop strategies to combat this phenomenon. This has prompted paramedic service managers to engage stakeholders to explore ways they could be more proactive in health promotion and hospital avoidance. Community paramedicine programs are fostering collaborative partnerships between disciplines, while the positive outcomes for patients and health cost savings are tangible motivators for paramedic services and funders. Paramedics were motivated by a genuine desire to make a difference and attracted to the innovative nature of a role delivering preventative care options for patients. Transitional challenges included lack of self-regulation, navigating untraditional roles and managing role boundary tensions between disciplines. Community paramedics in this study were largely self-selected, genuinely interested in the concept and proactively engaged in the grassroots development of these programs. These paramedics were comfortable integrating and operating within multidisciplinary teams. CONCLUSIONS: Improved education and communication from paramedic service management with staff and external stakeholders might improve transitional processes and better support a culture of inclusivity for community paramedicine programs. Experienced and highly motivated paramedics with excellent communication and interpersonal skills should be considered for community paramedic roles. Practitioners who are proactive about community paramedicine and self-nominate for positions transition more easily into the role: they tend to see the 'bigger picture', have broader insight into public health issues and the benefits of integrative health care. They are more likely to achieve higher job satisfaction, remain in the role longer, and contribute to better long-term program outcomes. Paramedic services and policymakers can use these findings to incentivize career pathways in community paramedicine and understand those changes that might better support this innovative model.","Perspectives from the frontline of two North American community paramedicine programs: an observational, ethnographic study.","['Adult', 'Allied Health Personnel/education/*organization & administration', 'Colorado', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Emergency Medical Services/*organization & administration', 'Emergency Medical Technicians/education/*organization & administration', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Interprofessional Relations', 'Male', 'Ontario', 'Primary Health Care/organization & administration', 'Qualitative Research', 'Rural Health Services/*organization & administration', 'United States']",,

Epub 2019 Feb 7.,2019/02/11 06:00,Journal of biomedical informatics,"OBJECTIVE: Supplementing the Spontaneous Reporting System (SRS) with Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for adverse drug reaction detection could augment sample size, increase population heterogeneity and cross-validate results for pharmacovigilance research. The difference in the underlying data structures and terminologies between SRS and EHR data presents challenges when attempting to integrate the two into a single database. The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaboration provides a Common Data Model (CDM) for organizing and standardizing EHR data to support large-scale observational studies. The objective of the study is to develop and evaluate an informatics platform known as ADEpedia-on-OHDSI, where spontaneous reporting data from FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is converted into the OHDSI CDM format towards building a next generation pharmacovigilance signal detection platform. METHODS: An extraction, transformation and loading (ETL) tool was designed, developed, and implemented to convert FAERS data into the OHDSI CDM format. A comprehensive evaluation, including overall ETL evaluation, mapping quality evaluation of drug names to RxNorm, and an evaluation of transformation and imputation quality, was then performed to assess the mapping accuracy and information loss using the FAERS data collected between 2012 and 2017. Previously published findings related to vascular safety profile of triptans were validated using ADEpedia-on-OHDSI in pharmacovigilance research. For the triptan-related vascular event detection, signals were detected by Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) in high-level group terms (HLGT) level, high-level terms (HLT) level and preferred term (PT) level using the original FAERS data and CDM-based FAERS respectively. In addition, six standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) related to vascular events were applied. RESULTS: A total of 4,619,362 adverse event cases were loaded into 8 tables in the OHDSI CDM. For drug name mapping, 93.9% records and 47.0% unique names were matched with RxNorm codes. Mapping accuracy of drug names was 96% based on a manual verification of randomly sampled 500 unique mappings. Information loss evaluation showed that more than 93% of the data is loaded into the OHDSI CDM for most fields, with the exception of drug route data (66%). The replication study detected 5, 18, 47 and 6, 18, 50 triptan-related vascular event signals in MedDRA HLGT level, HLT level, and PT level for the original FAERS data and CDM-based FAERS respectively. The signal detection scores of six standardized MedDRA queries (SMQs) of vascular events in the raw data study were found to be lower than those scores in the CDM study.

Data-driven cohort definition is appealing but requires substantial knowledge of terminologies and clinical data models. Criteria2Query is a natural language interface that facilitates human-computer collaboration for cohort definition and execution using clinical databases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Criteria2Query uses a hybrid information extraction pipeline combining machine learning and rule-based methods to systematically parse eligibility criteria text, transforms it first into a structured criteria representation and next into sharable and executable clinical data queries represented as SQL queries conforming to the OMOP Common Data Model. Users can interactively review, refine, and execute queries in the ATLAS web application. To test effectiveness, we evaluated 125 criteria across different disease domains from ClinicalTrials.gov and 52 user-entered criteria. We evaluated F1 score and accuracy against 2 domain experts and calculated the average computation time for fully automated query formulation. We conducted an anonymous survey evaluating usability. RESULTS: Criteria2Query achieved 0.795 and 0.805 F1 score for entity recognition and relation extraction, respectively. Accuracies for negation detection, logic detection, entity normalization, and attribute normalization were 0.984, 0.864, 0.514 and 0.793, respectively. Fully automatic query formulation took 1.22 seconds/criterion. More than 80% (11+ of 13) of users would use Criteria2Query in their future cohort definition tasks.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our work was to compare the accuracy of both common and innovative methods of data mining for pharmacovigilance purposes. METHODS: We used the reference standard provided by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership, which contains 398 drug-adverse event pairs (165 positive controls, 233 negative controls). Ten methods and algorithms were applied to the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data to investigate the 398 pairs. The ten methods include popular methods in the pharmacovigilance literature, newly developed pharmacovigilance methods as at 2018, and popular methods in the genome-wide association study literature. We compared their performance using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot, area under the curve (AUC), and Youden's index. RESULTS: The Bayesian confidence propagation neural network had the highest AUC overall. Monte Carlo expectation maximization, a method developed in 2018, had the second highest AUC and the highest Youden's index, and performed very well in terms of high specificity. The regression-adjusted gamma Poisson shrinkage model performed best under high-sensitivity requirements. CONCLUSION: Our results will be useful to help choose a method for a given desired level of specificity. Methods popular in the genome-wide association study literature did not perform well because of the sparsity of data and will need modification before their properties can be used in the drug-adverse event association problem.","A Comparison Study of Algorithms to Detect Drug-Adverse Event Associations: Frequentist, Bayesian, and Machine-Learning Approaches.","['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*statistics & numerical data', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Data Mining/statistics & numerical data', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*genetics/*prevention & control', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/methods', 'Humans', 'Machine Learning', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'ROC Curve', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",,

Overall survival (OS) and toxicities were analyzed as endpoints of the study. RESULTS: Median age of pts was 65 years. TKIs were given for EGFR (81%)- or ALK (19%)-mutated metastatic NSCLC. Stereotactic RT (SRT) was delivered to 49 pts (46%).

Data interoperability is paramount to the program's success. AOU is standardizing its EHR data around the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. OMOP is one of several standard data models presently used in national-scale initiatives. Each model is unique enough to make interoperability difficult. The i2b2 data warehousing and analytics platform is used at over 200 sites worldwide, which uses a flexible ontology-driven approach for data storage. We previously demonstrated this ontology system can drive data reconfiguration, to transform data into new formats without site-specific programming. We previously implemented this on our 12-site Accessible Research Commons for Health (ARCH) network to transform i2b2 into the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we leverage our investment in i2b2 high-performance transformations to support the AOU OMOP data pipeline. Because the ARCH ontology has gained widespread national interest (through the Accrual to Clinical Trials network, other PCORnet networks, and the Nebraska Lexicon), we leveraged sites' existing investments into this standard ontology. We developed an i2b2-to-OMOP transformation, driven by the ARCH-OMOP ontology and the OMOP concept mapping dictionary. We demonstrated and validated our approach in the AOU New England HPO (NEHPO). First, we transformed into OMOP a fake patient dataset in i2b2 and verified through AOU tools that the data was structurally compliant with OMOP. We then transformed a subset of data in the Partners Healthcare data warehouse into OMOP. We developed a checklist of assessments to ensure the transformed data had self-integrity (e.g., the distributions have an expected shape and required fields are populated), using OMOP's visual Achilles data quality tool. This i2b2-to-OMOP transformation is being used to send NEHPO production data to AOU.

In order to motivate these contributions, we explain how value sets fit into specific analytic tasks and the health analytics landscape more broadly; their growing importance and ubiquity with the advent of Common Data Models, Distributed Research Networks, and the availability of higher order, reusable analytic resources like electronic phenotypes and electronic clinical quality measures; the formidable barriers to value set reuse; and our introduction of a concept-agnostic orientation to vocabulary collections. The costs of ad hoc value set management and the benefits of value set reuse are described or implied throughout. Our standards, infrastructure, and design recommendations are not systematic or comprehensive but invite further work to support value set reuse for health analytics.

We evaluate the performance of a classifier, trained on structured EHR data, in identifying prostate cancer patients with metastatic disease. Using EHR data for a cohort of 5,861 prostate cancer patients mapped to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) data model, we constructed feature vectors containing frequency counts of conditions, procedures, medications, observations and laboratory values. Staging information from the California Cancer Registry was used as the ground-truth. For identifying patients with metastatic disease, a random forest model achieved precision and recall of 0.90, 0.40 using data within 12 months of diagnosis. This compared to precision 0.33, recall 0.54 for an ICD code-based query.

A distributed research network allows researchers to share this evidence rather than the patient-level data across centers, thereby avoiding privacy issues. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) used in distributed research networks has low coverage of sequencing data and does not reflect the latest trends of precision medicine. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the feasibility of a genomic CDM (G-CDM), as an extension of the OMOP-CDM, for application of genomic data in clinical practice. METHODS: Existing genomic data models and sequencing reports were reviewed to extend the OMOP-CDM to cover genomic data. The Human Genome Organisation Gene Nomenclature Committee and Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature were adopted to standardize the terminology in the model. Sequencing data of 114 and 1060 patients with lung cancer were obtained from the Ajou University School of Medicine database of Ajou University Hospital and The Cancer Genome Atlas, respectively, which were transformed to a format appropriate for the G-CDM. The data were compared with respect to gene name, variant type, and actionable mutations. RESULTS: The G-CDM was extended into four tables linked to tables of the OMOP-CDM. Upon comparison with The Cancer Genome Atlas data, a clinically actionable mutation, p.Leu858Arg, in the EGFR gene was 6.64 times more frequent in the Ajou University School of Medicine database, while the p.Gly12Xaa mutation in the KRAS gene was 2.02 times more frequent in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. The data-exploring tool GeneProfiler was further developed to conduct descriptive analyses automatically using the G-CDM, which provides the proportions of genes, variant types, and actionable mutations. GeneProfiler also allows for querying the specific gene name and Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature to calculate the proportion of patients with a given mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We developed the G-CDM for effective integration of genomic data with standardized clinical data, allowing for data sharing across institutes. The feasibility of the G-CDM was validated by assessing the differences in data characteristics between two different genomic databases through the proposed data-exploring tool GeneProfiler. The G-CDM may facilitate analyses of interoperating clinical and genomic datasets across multiple institutions, minimizing privacy issues and enabling researchers to better understand the characteristics of patients and promote personalized medicine in clinical practice.",Genomic Common Data Model for Seamless Interoperation of Biomedical Data in Clinical Practice: Retrospective Study.,"['Databases, Factual/*standards', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Precision Medicine/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",,

Some claims data do not contain complete death records, limiting their use for mortality or mortality-related studies. A model to predict whether a patient died at the end of the follow-up time (referred to as the end of observation) is needed to enable mortality-related studies. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a patient-level model to predict whether the end of observation was due to death in US claims data. METHODS: We used a claims dataset with full death records, Optum((c)) De-Identified Clinformatics((R)) Data-Mart-Database-Date of Death mapped to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model, to develop a model that classifies the end of observations into death or non-death. A regularized logistic regression was trained using 88,514 predictors (recorded within the prior 365 or 30 days) and externally validated by applying the model to three US claims datasets. RESULTS: Approximately 25 in 1000 end of observations in Optum are due to death. The Discriminating End of observation into Alive and Dead (DEAD) model obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.986. When defining death as a predicted risk of > 0.5, only 2% of the end of observations were predicted to be due to death and the model obtained a sensitivity of 62% and a positive predictive value of 74.8%. The external validation showed the model was transportable, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranging between 0.951 and 0.995 across the US claims databases. CONCLUSIONS: US claims data often lack complete death records. The DEAD model can be used to impute death at various sensitivity, specificity, or positive predictive values depending on the use of the model.

This study contributes a data element-function conceptual model to facilitate the categorization and indexing of DQ checks and explores the feasibility of leveraging natural language processing (NLP) for scalable acquisition of knowledge of common data elements and functions from DQ checks narratives. METHODS: The model defines a ""data element"", the primary focus of the check, and a ""function"", the qualitative or quantitative measure over a data element. We applied NLP techniques to extract both from 172 checks for Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) and 3,434 checks for Kaiser Permanente's Center for Effectiveness and Safety Research (CESR). RESULTS: The model was able to classify all checks. A total of 751 unique data elements and 24 unique functions were extracted. The top five frequent data element-function pairings for OHDSI were Person-Count (55 checks), Insurance-Distribution (17), Medication-Count (16), Condition-Count (14), and Observations-Count (13); for CESR, they were Medication-Variable Type (175), Medication-Missing (172), Medication-Existence (152), Medication-Count (127), and Socioeconomic Factors-Variable Type (114). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the efficacy of the data element-function conceptual model for classifying DQ checks, demonstrates early promise of NLP-assisted knowledge acquisition, and reveals the great heterogeneity in the focus in DQ checks, confirming variation in intrinsic checks and use-case specific ""fitness-for-use"" checks.",A Data Element-Function Conceptual Model for Data Quality Checks.,,,

Use of a common data model may facilitate the process. METHODS: Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) sites implemented the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model across their electronic health record (EHR)-linked DNA biobanks. Two previously implemented eMERGE phenotypes were converted to OMOP and implemented across the network. RESULTS: It was feasible to implement the common data model across sites, with laboratory data producing the greatest challenge due to local encoding. Sites were then able to execute the OMOP phenotype in less than one day, as opposed to weeks of effort to manually implement an eMERGE phenotype in their bespoke research EHR databases. Of the sites that could compare the current OMOP phenotype implementation with the original eMERGE phenotype implementation, specific agreement ranged from 100% to 43%, with disagreements due to the original phenotype, the OMOP phenotype, changes in data, and issues in the databases. Using the OMOP query as a standard comparison revealed differences in the original implementations despite starting from the same definitions, code lists, flowcharts, and pseudocode. CONCLUSION: Using a common data model can dramatically speed phenotype implementation at the cost of having to populate that data model, though this will produce a net benefit as the number of phenotype implementations increases. Inconsistencies among the implementations of the original queries point to a potential benefit of using a common data model so that actual phenotype code and logic can be shared, mitigating human error in reinterpretation of a narrative phenotype definition.",Facilitating phenotype transfer using a common data model.,"['Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*diagnosis', 'Data Collection', '*Databases, Factual', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diagnosis', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Medical Informatics', 'National Human Genome Research Institute (U.S.)', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Phenotype', 'Research Design', 'Software', 'United States']",,

Epub 2019 Jul 29.,2019/08/02 06:00,Journal of biomedical informatics,"BACKGROUND: The primary approach for defining disease in observational healthcare databases is to construct phenotype algorithms (PAs), rule-based heuristics predicated on the presence, absence, and temporal logic of clinical observations. However, a complete evaluation of PAs, i.e., determining sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV), is rarely performed. In this study, we propose a tool (PheValuator) to efficiently estimate a complete PA evaluation. METHODS: We used 4 administrative claims datasets: OptumInsight's de-identified Clinformatics Datamart (Eden Prairie,MN); IBM MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid); IBM MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Beneficiaries; and IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters from 2000 to 2017. Using PheValuator involves (1) creating a diagnostic predictive model for the phenotype, (2) applying the model to a large set of randomly selected subjects, and (3) comparing each subject's predicted probability for the phenotype to inclusion/exclusion in PAs. We used the predictions as a 'probabilistic gold standard' measure to classify positive/negative cases. We examined 4 phenotypes: myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. We examined several PAs for each phenotype including 1-time (1X) occurrence of the diagnosis code in the subject's record and 1-time occurrence of the diagnosis in an inpatient setting with the diagnosis code as the primary reason for admission (1X-IP-1stPos). RESULTS: Across phenotypes, the 1X PA showed the highest sensitivity/lowest PPV among all PAs. 1X-IP-1stPos yielded the highest PPV/lowest sensitivity. Specificity was very high across algorithms. We found similar results between algorithms across datasets.

IBM MarketScan Commercial is a claims database that can be linked to an additional health risk assessment with self-reported smoking status for a subset of 1,966,174 patients. We investigate whether this subset could be used to learn a smoking status phenotype model generalizable to all US claims data that calculates the probability of being a current smoker. METHODS: 251,643 (12.8%) had self-reported their smoking status as 'current smoker'. A regularized logistic regression model, the Current Risk of Smoking Status (CROSS), was trained using the subset of patients with self-reported smoking status. CROSS considered 53,027 candidate covariates including demographics and conditions/drugs/measurements/procedures/observations recorded in the prior 365 days, The CROSS phenotype model was validated across multiple other claims data. RESULTS: The internal validation showed the CROSS model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.76 and the calibration plots indicated it was well calibrated. The external validation across three US claims databases obtained AUCs ranging between 0.82 and 0.87 showing the model appears to be transportable across Claims data. CONCLUSION: CROSS predicts current smoking status based on the claims records in the prior year. CROSS can be readily implemented to any US insurance claims mapped to the OMOP common data model and will be a useful way to impute smoking status when conducting epidemiology studies where smoking is a known confounder but smoking status is not recorded.

METHOD: A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting of the editorial team was organized to conclude on the selection of best papers. RESULTS: Among the 1,469 retrieved papers published in 2018 in the various areas of CRI, the full review process selected four best papers. The first best paper describes a simple algorithm detecting co-morbidities in Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) using a clinical data warehouse and a knowledge base. The authors of the second best paper present a federated algorithm for predicting heart failure hospital admissions based on patients' medical history described in their distributed EHRs. The third best paper reports the evaluation of an open source, interoperable, and scalable data quality assessment tool measuring completeness of data items, which can be run on different architectures (EHRs and Clinical Data Warehouses (CDWs) based on PCORnet or OMOP data models). The fourth best paper reports a data quality program conducted across 37 hospitals addressing data quality Issues through the whole data life cycle from patient to researcher. CONCLUSIONS: Research efforts in the CRI field currently focus on consolidating promises of early Distributed Research Networks aimed at maximizing the potential of large-scale, harmonized data from diverse, quickly developing digital sources. Data quality assessment methods and tools as well as privacy-enhancing techniques are major concerns. It is also notable that, following examples in the US and Asia, ambitious regional or national plans in Europe are launched that aim at developing big data and new artificial intelligence technologies to contribute to the understanding of health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems, and returning actionable feedback loops to improve existing models of research and care.

However, results of these studies often cannot be replicated, and the advantage of this design over others is questionable. To demonstrate the shortcomings of applications of this design, we replicate two published case-control studies. The first investigates isotretinoin and ulcerative colitis using a simple case-control design. The second focuses on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and acute pancreatitis, using a nested case-control design. We include large sets of negative control exposures (where the true odds ratio is believed to be 1) in both studies. Both replication studies produce effect size estimates consistent with the original studies, but also generate estimates for the negative control exposures showing substantial residual bias. In contrast, applying a self-controlled design to answer the same questions using the same data reveals far less bias. Although the case-control design in general is not at fault, its application in retrospective database studies, where all exposure and covariate data for the entire cohort are available, is unnecessary, as other alternatives such as cohort and self-controlled designs are available. Moreover, by focusing on cases and controls it opens the door to inappropriate comparisons between exposure groups, leading to confounding for which the design has few options to adjust for. We argue that this design should no longer be used in these types of data. At the very least, negative control exposures should be used to prove that the concerns raised here do not apply.",A plea to stop using the case-control design in retrospective database studies.,"['Bias', '*Case-Control Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', '*Databases, Factual', 'Humans', '*Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies']",,

In this project, we assessed the feasibility of automatically detecting a patient's eligibility for a sample of breast cancer clinical trials by mapping coded clinical trial eligibility criteria to the corresponding clinical information automatically extracted from text in the EHR. METHODS: Three open breast cancer clinical trials were selected by oncologists. Their eligibility criteria were manually abstracted from trial descriptions using the OHDSI ATLAS web application. Patients enrolled or screened for these trials were selected as 'positive' or 'possible' cases. Other patients diagnosed with breast cancer were selected as 'negative' cases. A selection of the clinical data and all clinical notes of these 229 selected patients was extracted from the MUSC clinical data warehouse and stored in a database implementing the OMOP common data model. Eligibility criteria were extracted from clinical notes using either manually crafted pattern matching (regular expressions) or a new natural language processing (NLP) application. These extracted criteria were then compared with reference criteria from trial descriptions. This comparison was realized with three different versions of a new application: rule-based, cosine similarity-based, and machine learning-based. RESULTS: For eligibility criteria extraction from clinical notes, the machine learning-based NLP application allowed for the highest accuracy with a micro-averaged recall of 90.9% and precision of 89.7%. For trial eligibility determination, the highest accuracy was reached by the machine learning-based approach with a per-trial AUC between 75.5% and 89.8%. CONCLUSION: NLP can be used to extract eligibility criteria from EHR clinical notes and automatically discover patients possibly eligible for a clinical trial with good accuracy, which could be leveraged to reduce the workload of humans screening patients for trials.",Automatic trial eligibility surveillance based on unstructured clinical data.,"['Automation', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Data Warehousing', 'Databases, Factual', '*Eligibility Determination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Selection', 'Workload']",,

Epub 2019 Sep 19.,2019/09/23 06:00,Journal of biomedical informatics,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of phenotype algorithms requires phenotype engineers to interpret human-readable algorithms and translate the description (text and flowcharts) into computable phenotypes - a process that can be labor intensive and error prone. To address the critical need for reducing the implementation efforts, it is important to develop portable algorithms. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of phenotype algorithms developed in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network and identified common customization tasks required for implementation. A novel scoring system was developed to quantify portability from three aspects: Knowledge conversion, clause Interpretation, and Programming (KIP). Tasks were grouped into twenty representative categories. Experienced phenotype engineers were asked to estimate the average time spent on each category and evaluate time saving enabled by a common data model (CDM), specifically the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) model, for each category. RESULTS: A total of 485 distinct clauses (phenotype criteria) were identified from 55 phenotype algorithms, corresponding to 1153 customization tasks. In addition to 25 non-phenotype-specific tasks, 46 tasks are related to interpretation, 613 tasks are related to knowledge conversion, and 469 tasks are related to programming. A score between 0 and 2 (0 for easy, 1 for moderate, and 2 for difficult portability) is assigned for each aspect, yielding a total KIP score range of 0 to 6. The average clause-wise KIP score to reflect portability is 1.37 +/- 1.38. Specifically, the average knowledge (K) score is 0.64 +/- 0.66, interpretation (I) score is 0.33 +/- 0.55, and programming (P) score is 0.40 +/- 0.64. 5% of the categories can be completed within one hour (median). 70% of the categories take from days to months to complete. The OMOP model can assist with vocabulary mapping tasks. CONCLUSION: This study presents firsthand knowledge of the substantial implementation efforts in phenotyping and introduces a novel metric (KIP) to measure portability of phenotype algorithms for quantifying such efforts across the eMERGE Network. Phenotype developers are encouraged to analyze and optimize the portability in regards to knowledge, interpretation and programming.

Identification of cohorts using electronic health records is an important step in this process. Previous studies largely focused on the methods of cohort selection, but there is little evidence on the impact of underlying vocabularies and mappings between vocabularies used for cohort selection. We aim to compare the cohort selection performance using Australian Medicines Terminology to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) mappings from 2 different sources. These mappings were taken from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) schedule. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved patients from the electronic Practice Based Research Network data repository using 3 ATC classification groups (A10, N02A, N06A). The retrieved patients were further verified manually and pooled to form a reference standard which was used to assess the accuracy of mappings using precision, recall, and F measure metrics. RESULTS: The OMOP-CDM mappings identified 2.6%, 15.2%, and 24.4% more drugs than the PBS mappings in the A10, N02A and N06A groups respectively. Despite this, the PBS mappings generally performed the same in cohort selection as OMOP-CDM mappings except for the N02A Opioids group, where a significantly greater number of patients were retrieved. Both mappings exhibited variable recall, but perfect precision, with all drugs found to be correctly identified. CONCLUSION: We found that 1 of the 3 ATC groups had a significant difference and this affected cohort selection performance. Our findings highlighted that underlying terminology mappings can greatly impact cohort selection accuracy.

METHODS: We mapped ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM codes to phecodes using a number of methods and resources, such as concept relationships and explicit mappings from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Unified Medical Language System, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms, and the National Library of Medicine. We assessed the coverage of the maps in two databases: Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) using ICD-10-CM and the UK Biobank (UKBB) using ICD-10. We assessed the fidelity of the ICD-10-CM map in comparison to the gold-standard ICD-9-CM phecode map by investigating phenotype reproducibility and conducting a PheWAS. RESULTS: We mapped >75% of ICD-10 and ICD-10-CM codes to phecodes. Of the unique codes observed in the UKBB (ICD-10) and VUMC (ICD-10-CM) cohorts, >90% were mapped to phecodes.

The KETOS platform demonstrated in this work implements a tool for researchers allowing them to perform statistical analyses and deploy resulting models in a secure environment. METHODS: The proposed system uses Docker virtualization to provide researchers with reproducible data analysis and development environments, accessible via Jupyter Notebook, to perform statistical analysis and develop, train and deploy models based on standardized input data. The platform is built in a modular fashion and interfaces with web services using the Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard to access patient data. In our prototypical implementation we use an OMOP common data model (OMOP-CDM) database. The architecture supports the entire research lifecycle from creating a data analysis environment, retrieving data, and training to final deployment in a hospital setting. RESULTS: We evaluated the platform by establishing and deploying an analysis and end user application for hemoglobin reference intervals within the University Hospital Erlangen. To demonstrate the potential of the system to deploy arbitrary models, we loaded a colorectal cancer dataset into an OMOP database and built machine learning models to predict patient outcomes and made them available via a web service. We demonstrated both the integration with FHIR as well as an example end user application. Finally, we integrated the platform with the open source DataSHIELD architecture to allow for distributed privacy preserving data analysis and training across networks of hospitals. CONCLUSION: The KETOS platform takes a novel approach to data analysis, training and deploying decision support models in a hospital or healthcare setting. It does so in a secure and privacy-preserving manner, combining the flexibility of Docker virtualization with the advantages of standardized vocabularies, a widely applied database schema (OMOP-CDM), and a standardized way to exchange medical data (FHIR).","KETOS: Clinical decision support and machine learning as a service - A training and deployment platform based on Docker, OMOP-CDM, and FHIR Web Services.","['Colorectal Neoplasms/therapy', '*Decision Support Systems, Clinical', '*Health Information Interoperability', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Internet', '*Machine Learning', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Privacy', 'Reference Values', 'Treatment Outcome', 'User-Computer Interface']",,

Enterprise data warehouses have emerged as central resources for these data, but often require an informatician to extract meaningful information, limiting direct access by end users. To overcome this challenge, we have developed Leaf, a lightweight self-service web application for querying clinical data from heterogeneous data models and sources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leaf utilizes a flexible biomedical concept system to define hierarchical concepts and ontologies. Each Leaf concept contains both textual representations and SQL query building blocks, exposed by a simple drag-and-drop user interface. Leaf generates abstract syntax trees which are compiled into dynamic SQL queries. RESULTS: Leaf is a successful production-supported tool at the University of Washington, which hosts a central Leaf instance querying an enterprise data warehouse with over 300 active users. Through the support of UW Medicine (https://uwmedicine.org), the Institute of Translational Health Sciences (https://www.iths.org), and the National Center for Data to Health (https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/), Leaf source code has been released into the public domain at https://github.com/uwrit/leaf. DISCUSSION: Leaf allows the querying of single or multiple clinical databases simultaneously, even those of different data models. This enables fast installation without costly extraction or duplication. CONCLUSIONS: Leaf differs from existing cohort discovery tools because it does not specify a required data model and is designed to seamlessly leverage existing user authentication systems and clinical databases in situ. We believe Leaf to be useful for health system analytics, clinical research data warehouses, precision medicine biobanks, and clinical studies involving large patient cohorts.","Leaf: an open-source, model-agnostic, data-driven web application for cohort discovery and translational biomedical research.","['*Data Warehousing', 'Databases as Topic', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods', 'Internet', '*Translational Research, Biomedical', 'Unified Medical Language System', '*User-Computer Interface', '*Vocabulary, Controlled']",,

Whether observational data can be used to address the same clinical questions being answered by traditional clinical trials is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To identify the number of clinical trials published in high-impact journals in 2017 that could be feasibly replicated using observational data from insurance claims and/or electronic health records (EHRs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional analysis, PubMed was searched to identify all US-based clinical trials, regardless of randomization, published between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2017, in the top 7 highest-impact general medical journals of 2017. Trials were excluded if they did not involve human participants, did not use end points that represented clinical outcomes among patients, were not characterized as clinical trials, and had no recruitment sites in the United States. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the number and percentage of trials for which the intervention, indication, trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, and primary end points could be ascertained from insurance claims and/or EHR data. RESULTS: Of the 220 US-based trials analyzed, 33 (15.0%) could be replicated using observational data because their intervention, indication, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and primary end points could be routinely ascertained from insurance claims and/or EHR data. Of the 220 trials, 86 (39.1%) had an intervention that could be ascertained from insurance claims and/or EHR data. Among the 86 trials, 62 (72.1%) had an indication that could be ascertained. Forty-five (72.6%) of 62 trials had at least 80% of inclusion and exclusion criteria data that could be ascertained. Of these 45 studies, 33 (73.3%) had at least 1 primary end point that could be ascertained. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that only 15% of the US-based clinical trials published in high-impact journals in 2017 could be feasibly replicated through analysis of administrative claims or EHR data. This finding suggests the potential for real-world evidence to complement clinical trials, both by examining the concordance between randomized experiments and observational studies and by comparing the generalizability of the trial population with the real-world population of interest.",Feasibility of Using Real-World Data to Replicate Clinical Trial Evidence.,"['*Bibliometrics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health', 'Observational Studies as Topic/statistics & numerical data', '*Reproducibility of Results']",,

The nature of the data, however, requires expertise in both data science and EHR structure. The Observational Medical Out-comes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) standardizes the language and structure of EHR data to promote interoperability of EHR data for research. While the OMOP CDM is valuable and more attuned to research purposes, it still requires extensive domain knowledge to utilize effectively, potentially limiting more widespread adoption of EHR data for research and quality improvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have created ROMOP: an R package for direct interfacing with EHR data in the OMOP CDM format. RESULTS: ROMOP streamlines typical EHR-related data processes. Its functions include exploration of data types, extraction and summarization of patient clinical and demographic data, and patient searches using any CDM vocabulary concept. CONCLUSION: ROMOP is freely available under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license and can be obtained from GitHub (http://github.com/BenGlicksberg/ROMOP). We detail instructions for setup and use in the Supplementary Materials.

However, transforming a data system into a CDM is not a trivial task, and maintaining an operational, enterprise capable CDM that is incrementally updated within a data warehouse is challenging. OBJECTIVES: To develop a quality assurance (QA) process and code base to accompany our incremental transformation of the Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse health care database into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM to prevent incremental load errors. METHODS: We designed and implemented a multistage QA) approach centered on completeness, value conformance, and relational conformance data-quality elements. For each element we describe key incremental load challenges, our extract, transform, and load (ETL) solution of data to overcome those challenges, and potential impacts of incremental load failure. RESULTS: Completeness and value conformance data-quality elements are most affected by incremental changes to the CDW, while updates to source identifiers impact relational conformance. ETL failures surrounding these elements lead to incomplete and inaccurate capture of clinical concepts as well as data fragmentation across patients, providers, and locations. CONCLUSION: Development of robust QA processes supporting accurate transformation of OMOP and other CDMs from source data is still in evolution, and opportunities exist to extend the existing QA framework and tools used for incremental ETL QA processes.",Incrementally Transforming Electronic Medical Records into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model: A Multidimensional Quality Assurance Approach.,"['Delivery of Health Care', 'Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data', '*Models, Statistical', '*Quality Assurance, Health Care']",,

Integrated EHR data can provide a larger sample size of the population to improve estimation and prediction accuracy. To overcome the obstacle of sharing patient-level data, distributed algorithms were developed to conduct statistical analyses across multiple clinical sites through sharing only aggregated information. However, the heterogeneity of data across sites is often ignored by existing distributed algorithms, which leads to substantial bias when studying the association between the outcomes and exposures. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient distributed algorithm which accounts for the heterogeneity caused by a small number of the clinical sites. We evaluated our algorithm through a systematic simulation study motivated by real-world scenarios and applied our algorithm to multiple claims datasets from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network.

The ability to combine veterinary and human medical data provides a unique resource to study the interactions and relationships between animals, humans, and the environment.

However, administrative claims data do not contain the necessary information to develop accurate algorithms for disorders that require laboratory results, and this omission can result in insensitive diagnostic code-based algorithms. In this paper, we tested our assertion that the performance of a diagnosis code-based algorithm for chronic kidney disorder (CKD) can be improved by adding other codes indirectly related to CKD (e.g., codes for dialysis, kidney transplant, suspicious kidney disorders). Following the best practices from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), we adapted an electronic health record-based gold standard algorithm for CKD and then created algorithms that can be executed on administrative claims data and account for related data quality issues. We externally validated our algorithms on four electronic health record datasets in the OHDSI network. Compared to the algorithm that uses CKD diagnostic codes only, positive predictive value of the algorithms that use additional codes was slightly increased (47.4% vs. 47.9-48.5% respectively). The algorithms adapted from the gold standard algorithm can be used to infer chronic kidney disorder based on administrative claims data. We succeeded in improving the generalizability and consistency of the CKD phenotypes by using data and vocabulary standardized across the OHDSI network, although performance variability across datasets remains. We showed that identifying and addressing coding and data heterogeneity can improve the performance of the algorithms.",Adapting electronic health records-derived phenotypes to claims data: Lessons learned in using limited clinical data for phenotyping.,"['Algorithms', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Medical Informatics', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",,

Thus, identifying risk factors and making an early prediction of HT in acute cerebral infarction contributes not only to the selections of therapeutic regimen but also, more importantly, to the improvement of prognosis of acute cerebral infarction. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a model to predict a patient's risk of HT within 30 days of initial ischemic stroke. METHODS: We utilized a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study design to develop a Lasso Logistic Regression prediction model with a large, US Electronic Health Record dataset which structured to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). To examine clinical transportability, the model was externally validated across 10 additional real-world healthcare datasets include EHR records for patients from America, Europe and Asia. RESULTS: In the database the model was developed, the target population cohort contained 621,178 patients with ischemic stroke, of which 5,624 patients had HT within 30 days following initial ischemic stroke. 612 risk predictors, including the distance a patient travels in an ambulance to get to care for a HT, were identified. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 was achieved in the internal validation of the risk model. External validation was performed across 10 databases totaling 5,515,508 patients with ischemic stroke, of which 86,401 patients had HT within 30 days following initial ischemic stroke. The mean external AUC was 0.71 and ranged between 0.60-0.78. CONCLUSIONS: A HT prognostic predict model was developed with Lasso Logistic Regression based on routinely collected EMR data. This model can identify patients who have a higher risk of HT than the population average with an AUC of 0.78. It shows the OMOP CDM is an appropriate data standard for EMR secondary use in clinical multicenter research for prognostic prediction model development and validation.

Moreover, CDMs provide tools for data quality assessment, integration into models, visualization, and analysis. The observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) provides a CDM for organizing and standardizing databases. Common data models not only facilitate data integration but also (and especially for the OMOP model) extends the range of available statistical analyses. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing French national electronic health records in the OMOP CDM. METHODS: The OMOP's specifications were used to audit the source data, specify the transformation into the OMOP CDM, implement an extract-transform-load process to feed data from the French health care system into the OMOP CDM, and evaluate the final database. RESULTS: Seventeen vocabularies corresponding to the French context were added to the OMOP CDM's concepts. Three French terminologies were automatically mapped to standardized vocabularies. We loaded nine tables from the OMOP CDM's ""standardized clinical data"" section, and three tables from the ""standardized health system data"" section. Outpatient and inpatient data from 38,730 individuals were integrated. The median (interquartile range) number of outpatient and inpatient stays per patient was 160 (19-364). CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that data from the French national health care system can be integrated into the OMOP CDM. One of the main challenges was the use of international OMOP concepts to annotate data recorded in a French context. The use of local terminologies was an obstacle to conceptual mapping; with the exception of an adaptation of the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision, the French health care system does not use international terminologies.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 10,674 patients who received IUDs at Columbia University Medical Center. Our data were transformed to a common data model and are part of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network. The cohort patients and outcomes were identified by a combination of procedure codes, condition codes, and medication exposures in billing and claims data. We adjusted for confounding with propensity score stratification and propensity score 1:1 matching. RESULTS: Before propensity score adjustment, the Cu IUD cohort included 8,274 patients and the LNG-IUS cohort included 2,400 patients. The median age for both cohorts was 29 years at IUD placement. More than 95% of the LNG-IUS cohort used a device with 52 mg LNG. Before propensity score adjustment, we identified 114 cervical neoplasm outcomes. Seventy-seven (0.9%) cervical neoplasms were in the Cu IUD cohort and 37 (1.5%) were in the LNG-IUS cohort. The propensity score matching analysis identified 7,114 Cu IUD and 2,174 LNG-IUS users, with covariate balance achieved over 16,827 covariates. The diagnosis of high-grade cervical neoplasia was 0.7% in the Cu IUD cohort and 1.8% in the LNG-IUS cohort (2.4 [95% CI 1.5-4.0] cases/1,000 person-years and 5.2 [95% CI 3.7-7.1] cases/1,000 person-years, respectively).

This retrospective multicentre analysis aims to analyse clinical outcomes and treatment related toxicity of patients treated to all sites of know disease with SRS and/or FSRT for OM/OP NSCLC in 8 Italian radiation oncology centres. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2016 to January 2017 198 OM/OP NSCLC patients (pts) were treated in 8 Centres. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 1-5 lesions at onset or after previous systemic treatment; Pts must have all metastatic lesions treated. Endpoints analysed were local progression free survival (LPFS); out-of-field recurrence free survival (OFPS); progression free survival (PFS); overall survival (OS). Time to New systemic Therapy free survival (TNT) and toxicity were also analysed. RESULTS: At the time of radiotherapy, 119 pts (60 %) were treated for a single lesion, 49 (25 %) for 2 lesions, 30 (15 %) for 3-5 metastases. Total number of lesions treated was 333: 204 brain, 68 lung, 24 bone, 16 nodal, 12 adrenal, 8 liver and 1 soft tissue. 83/198 pts (41.8 %) had the primary tumour controlled at the time of the SRT. After a median follow-up of 18 months, median OS and PFS were 29.6 months and 10.6 months, respectively. One year LPFS and OPFS were 90 % and 47 %, respectively. Median TNT was 10 months. At univariate analysis factors associated with better OS were PS 0-1; controlled primary tumour, 1-2 lesions; extracranial metastasis. Multivariate analysis confirmed number of lesions <3 and extracranial metastasis to be related with better survival (Relative Risk 0.4 and 0.41, respectively). Two cases of death possibly related to brain radionecrosis were observed. CONCLUSION: OM/OP NSCLC pts treated with an ablative SRT to all metastatic sites have fair outcomes with acceptable toxicity. Better results might be achieved in case of low disease burden and extracranial possibly when primary tumour is controlled.","Radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in oligometastatic/oligoprogressive non-small cell lung cancer patients: Results of a multi-institutional series of 198 patients treated with ""curative"" intent.","['Adenocarcinoma of Lung/*secondary/therapy', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*pathology/therapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*secondary/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Radiosurgery/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,

A further objective was to list the most commonly used drugs per drug class, per country. DESIGN AND SETTING: Hospital inpatient and insurance paediatric healthcare data from the following databases were used to conduct this descriptive drug utilisation study: (i) the South Korean Ajou University School of Medicine database; (ii) the Hong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System; (iii) the Japan Medical Data Center; (iv) Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database and (v) the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Country-specific data were transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. PATIENTS: Children (</=18 years) with at least 1 day of observation in any of the respective databases from January 2009 until December 2013 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each drug class, we assessed the per-protocol overall user and prescription prevalence rates (per 1000 persons) per country and setting. RESULTS: Our study population comprised 1 574 524 children (52.9% male). The highest proportion of dispensings was recorded in the youngest age category (<2 years) for inpatients (45.1%) with a relatively high user prevalence of analgesics and antibiotics. Adrenergics, antihistamines, mucolytics and corticosteroids were used in 10%-15% of patients. For ambulatory patients, the highest proportion of dispensings was recorded in the middle age category (2-11 years, 67.1%) with antibiotics the most dispensed drug overall. CONCLUSIONS: Country-specific paediatric drug utilisation patterns were described, ranked and compared between four East Asian countries and Australia.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a diagnostic predictive model to identify those in end-of-life care at the time of a drug exposure. METHODS: We used data from four administrative claims datasets from 2000 to 2017. The index date was the date of the first prescription for the last new drug subjects received during their observation period. The outcome of end-of-life care was determined by the presence of one or more codes indicating terminal or hospice care. Models were developed using regularized logistic regression. Internal validation was through examination of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and through model calibration in a 25% subset of the data held back from model training. External validation was through examination of the AUC after applying the model learned on one dataset to the three other datasets. RESULTS: The models showed excellent performance characteristics. Internal validation resulted in AUCs ranging from 0.918 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.905-0.930) to 0.983 (95% CI 0.978-0.987) for the four different datasets. Calibration results were also very good, with slopes near unity. External validation also produced very good to excellent performance metrics, with AUCs ranging from 0.840 (95% CI 0.834-0.846) to 0.956 (95% CI 0.952-0.960). CONCLUSION: These results show that developing diagnostic predictive models for determining subjects in end-of-life care at the time of a drug treatment is possible and may improve the validity of the risk profile for those treatments.",Developing Predictive Models to Determine Patients in End-of-Life Care in Administrative Datasets.,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Theoretical', '*Terminal Care']",,

However, data for youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are limited, even in developed countries. We compared the prevalence of DKA at diagnosis among individuals with T1D and T2D from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) and the Registry of Youth Onset Diabetes in India (YDR) registries. METHODS: We harmonized the SEARCH and YDR registries to the structure and terminology in the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership Common Data Model. Data used were from youth with T1D and T2D diagnosed before 20 years and newly diagnosed between 2006 and 2012 in YDR and 2009 and 2012 in SEARCH. RESULTS: There were 5366 US youth (4078 with T1D, 1288 with T2D) and 2335 Indian youth (2108 with T1D, 227 with T2D). More than one third of T1D youth enrolled in SEARCH had DKA at diagnosis which was significantly higher than in YDR (35.3% vs 28.7%, P < .0001). The burden of DKA in youth with T1D was significantly higher among younger age groups; this relationship was similar across registries (P = .4). The prevalence of DKA among T2D in SEARCH and YDR were 5.5% and 6.6% respectively (P = .4). CONCLUSIONS: There is significant burden of DKA at diagnosis with T1D among youth from United States and India, especially among the younger age groups. The reasons for this high prevalence are largely unknown but are critical to developing interventions to prevent DKA at diagnosis.",Diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis among youth with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: Results from SEARCH (United States) and YDR (India) registries.,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*diagnosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diagnosis', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Registries', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,

Although a variety of methods exist for screening for AF, a targeted approach, which requires an efficient method for identifying patients at risk, would be preferred. OBJECTIVE: To examine machine learning approaches applied to electronic health record data that have been harmonized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model for identifying risk of AF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic study used data from 2 252 219 individuals cared for in the UCHealth hospital system, which comprises 3 large hospitals in Colorado, from January 1, 2011, to October 1, 2018. Initial analysis was performed in December 2018; follow-up analysis was performed in July 2019. EXPOSURES: All Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model-harmonized electronic health record features, including diagnoses, procedures, medications, age, and sex. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Classification of incident AF in designated 6-month intervals, adjudicated retrospectively, based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and F1 statistic. RESULTS: Of 2 252 219 individuals (1 225 533 [54.4%] women; mean [SD] age, 42.9 [22.3] years), 28 036 (1.2%) developed incident AF during a designated 6-month interval. The machine learning model that used the 200 most common electronic health record features, including age and sex, and random oversampling with a single-layer, fully connected neural network provided the optimal prediction of 6-month incident AF, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.800 and an F1 score of 0.110. This model performed only slightly better than a more basic logistic regression model composed of known clinical risk factors for AF, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.794 and an F1 score of 0.079.

However, there are limited standardized population-based data in contemporary youth cohorts for comparison of clinical and demographic characteristics of diabetes for both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D). METHODS: In partnership, we harmonized demographic and clinical data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth (SEARCH) registry in the United States and the Registry of People with Diabetes with Youth Age at Onset (YDR) in India to the structure and terminology of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Data were from youth with T1D and T2D, aged <20 years and newly diagnosed between 2006 and 2010. We compared key characteristics across registries using chi(2) tests and t-tests. RESULTS: In total, there were 9650 youth with T1D and 2406 youth with T2D from 2006 to 2012. SEARCH youth were diagnosed at younger ages than YDR youth for T1D and T2D (10.0 vs 10.5 years, P < .001 and 14.7 vs 16.1 years, P < .001, respectively). For T2D, SEARCH had a higher proportion of females and significantly lower proportion of youth of high socioeconomic status compared to YDR. For T1D and T2D, SEARCH youth had higher BMI, lower blood pressure, and lower A1c compared to YDR youth. CONCLUSIONS: These data offer insights into the demographic and clinical characteristics of diabetes in youth across the two countries. Further research is needed to better understand why these differences exist.",Clinical profile at diagnosis with youth-onset type 1 and type 2 diabetes in two pediatric diabetes registries: SEARCH (United States) and YDR (India).,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Demography', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Registries', 'United States/epidemiology']",,

However, the heterogeneous nature of RWD poses challenges when working with more than one source, some of which can be solved by analyzing databases converted into a common data model (CDM). The main objective of the study was to evaluate the implementation of the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) CDM on IQVIA Medical Research Data (IMRD)-UK data. A drug utilization study describing the prescribing of codeine for pain in children was used as a case study to be replicated in IMRD-UK and its corresponding OMOP CDM transformation. Differences between IMRD-UK source and OMOP CDM were identified and investigated. In IMRD-UK updated to May 2017, results were similar between source and transformed data with few discrepancies. These were the result of different conventions applied during the transformation regarding the date of birth for children younger than 15 years and the start of the observation period, and of a misclassification of two drug treatments. After the initial analysis and feedback provided, a rerun of the analysis in IMRD-UK updated to September 2018 showed almost identical results for all the measures analyzed. For this study, the conversion to OMOP CDM was adequate. Although some decisions and mapping could be improved, these impacted on the absolute results but not on the study inferences.

Furthermore, it is speculated that the stronger acid suppression by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) potentially enhance infectious complications. This study aimed to compare the risk of CDI between PPIs and histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs). METHODS: Using the long-term database of the Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, we identified outpatients treated with PPIs and H2RAs for >/= 7 days from January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2018. We conducted Cox regression analysis to examine the hazard ratio (HR) of CDI after propensity score matching. RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 1.2 years (interquartile range, 0.2-3.2 years), the initial CDI occurrence differed significantly between matched cohorts of patients taking PPIs and H2RAs [PPIs vs H2RAs, 88/31 095 person years vs 47/32 836 person years; HR, 2.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-3.96; P = 0.005]. Almost 50% of all events occurred within 1 year of drug exposure. The risk of CDIs was significantly greater among groups receiving PPIs or H2RAs than in matched controls (PPIs vs control: HR, 2.65; 95% CI 1.28-5.79; P = 0.011; and H2RAs vs control: HR 2.43; 95% CI 1.09-5.68; P = 0.034]. CONCLUSION: In long-term hospital cohort, outpatient-based PPIs were associated with greater risk of CDI than H2RAs.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide as first-line therapies for hypertension in real-world practice. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a Large-Scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation in a Network of Databases (LEGEND) observational comparative cohort study with large-scale propensity score stratification and negative-control and synthetic positive-control calibration on databases spanning January 2001 through December 2018. Outpatient and inpatient care episodes of first-time users of antihypertensive monotherapy in the United States based on 2 administrative claims databases and 1 collection of electronic health records were analyzed. Analysis began June 2018. EXPOSURES: Chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were acute myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and a composite cardiovascular disease outcome including the first 3 outcomes and sudden cardiac death. Fifty-one safety outcomes were measured. RESULTS: Of 730 225 individuals (mean [SD] age, 51.5 [13.3] years; 450 100 women [61.6%]), 36 918 were dispensed or prescribed chlorthalidone and had 149 composite outcome events, and 693 337 were dispensed or prescribed hydrochlorothiazide and had 3089 composite outcome events. No significant difference was found in the associated risk of myocardial infarction, hospitalized heart failure, or stroke, with a calibrated hazard ratio for the composite cardiovascular outcome of 1.00 for chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide (95% CI, 0.85-1.17). Chlorthalidone was associated with a significantly higher risk of hypokalemia (hazard ratio [HR], 2.72; 95% CI, 2.38-3.12), hyponatremia (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16-1.47), acute renal failure (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15-1.63), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.09-1.42), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12-1.30). Chlorthalidone was associated with a significantly lower risk of diagnosed abnormal weight gain (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.61-0.86). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that chlorthalidone use was not associated with significant cardiovascular benefits when compared with hydrochlorothiazide, while its use was associated with greater risk of renal and electrolyte abnormalities. These findings do not support current recommendations to prefer chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension treatment in first-time users was found.

BACKGROUND: The French National Healthcare System Database (SNDS), covering 99% of the French population, provides a potentially valuable opportunity for drug safety alert generation. ALCAPONE aimed to assess empirically in the SNDS case-based designs for alert generation related to four health outcomes of interest. METHODS: ALCAPONE used a reference set adapted from observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) and Exploring and Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions (EU-ADR) project, with four outcomes-acute liver injury (ALI), myocardial infarction (MI), acute kidney injury (AKI), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB)-and positive and negative drug controls. ALCAPONE consisted of four main phases: (1) data preparation to fit the OMOP Common Data Model and select the drug controls; (2) detection of the selected controls via three case-based designs: case-population, case-control, and self-controlled case series, including design variants (varying risk window, adjustment strategy, etc.); (3) comparison of design variant performance (area under the ROC curve, mean square error, etc.); and (4) selection of the optimal design variants and their calibration for each outcome. RESULTS: Over 2009-2014, 5225 cases of ALI, 354 109 MI, 12 633 AKI, and 156 057 UGIB were identified using specific definitions. The number of detectable drugs ranged from 61 for MI to 25 for ALI. Design variants generated more than 50 000 points estimates. Results by outcome will be published in forthcoming papers.

METHODS: The SEARCH and YDR data were harmonized to the structure and terminology in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Data used were from T1D and T2D youth diagnosed <20 years between 2006-2012 for YDR, and 2006, 2008, and 2012 for SEARCH. We compared treatment regimens and A1c levels across the two registries. RESULTS: There were 4003 T1D (SEARCH = 1899; YDR = 2104) and 611 T2D (SEARCH = 384; YDR = 227) youth. The mean A1c was higher in YDR compared to SEARCH (T1D:11.0% +/- 2.9% vs 7.8% +/- 1.7%, P < .001; T2D:9.9% +/- 2.8% vs 7.2% +/- 2.1%, P < .001). Among T1D youth in SEARCH, 65.1% were on a basal/bolus regimen, whereas in YDR, 52.8% were on once/twice daily insulin regimen. Pumps were used by 16.2% of SEARCH and 1.5% of YDR youth with T1D. Among T2D youth, in SEARCH and YDR, a majority were on metformin only (43.0% vs 30.0%), followed by insulin + any oral hypoglycemic agents (26.3% vs 13.7%) and insulin only (12.8% vs 18.9%), respectively. CONCLUSION: We found significant differences between SEARCH and YDR in treatment patterns in T1D and T2D.

While treatment guidelines and care variations for these comorbidities have been described for the general noncancer population, less is known about real-world treatment patterns in patients with cancer. We sought to characterize the prevalence and distribution of initial treatment patterns across a large-scale data network for depression, hypertension, and type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among patients with cancer. METHODS: We used the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network, an international collaborative implementing the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model to standardize more than 2 billion patient records. For this study, we used 8 databases across 3 countries-the United States, France, and Germany-with 295,529,655 patient records. We identified patients with cancer using SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine) codes validated via manual review. We then characterized the treatment patterns of these patients initiating treatment of depression, hypertension, or T2DM with persistent treatment and at least 365 days of observation. RESULTS: Across databases, wide variations exist in treatment patterns for depression (n = 1,145,510), hypertension (n = 3,178,944), and T2DM (n = 886,766). When limited to 6-node (6-drug) sequences, we identified 61,052 unique sequences for depression, 346,067 sequences for hypertension, and 40,629 sequences for T2DM. These variations persisted across sites, databases, countries, and conditions, with the exception of metformin (73.8%) being the most common initial T2DM treatment. The most common initial medications were sertraline (17.5%) and escitalopram (17.5%) for depression and hydrochlorothiazide (20.5%) and lisinopril (19.6%) for hypertension. CONCLUSION: We identified wide variations in the treatment of common comorbidities in patients with cancer, similar to the general population, and demonstrate the feasibility of conducting research on patients with cancer across a large-scale observational data network using a common data model.",Treatment Patterns for Chronic Comorbid Conditions in Patients With Cancer Using a Large-Scale Observational Data Network.,"['Comorbidity', 'Databases, Factual/*statistics & numerical data', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Drug Utilization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data', 'France/epidemiology', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Prevalence', '*Quality of Life', 'United States/epidemiology']",,

Comparison of incidence, across diabetes registries, has the potential to inform hypotheses for risk factors. We sought to compare the incidence of diabetes in the U.S.-based registry of youth onset diabetes (SEARCH) to the Registry of Diabetes with Young Age at Onset (YDR-Chennai and New Delhi regions) in India. METHODS: We harmonized data from both SEARCH and YDR to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. Data were from youth registered with incident diabetes (2006-2012). Denominators were from census and membership data. We calculated diabetes incidence by averaging the total cases across the entire follow-up period and dividing this by the estimated census population corresponding to the source population for case ascertainment. Incidence was calculated for each of the registries and compared by type and within age and sex categories using a 2-sided, skew-corrected inverted score test. RESULTS: Incidence of type 1 was higher in SEARCH (21.2 cases/100 000 [95% CI: 19.9, 22.5]) than YDR (4.9 cases/100 000 [95% CI: 4.3, 5.6]). Incidence of type 2 diabetes was also higher in SEARCH (5.9 cases/100 000 [95% CI: 5.3, 6.6] in SEARCH vs 0.5/cases/100 000 [95% CI: 0.3, 0.7] in YDR). The age distribution of incident type 1 diabetes cases was similar across registries, whereas type 2 diabetes incidence was higher at an earlier age in SEARCH. Sex differences existed in SEARCH only, with a higher rate of type 2 diabetes among females. CONCLUSION: The incidence of youth-onset type 1 and 2 diabetes was significantly different between registries. Additional data are needed to elucidate whether the differences observed represent diagnostic delay, differences in genetic susceptibility, or differences in distribution of risk factors.",Comparison of the incidence of diabetes in United States and Indian youth: An international harmonization of youth diabetes registries.,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*epidemiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Registries', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,

To support data quality assessment within such a tool, we extended the open-source software Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) to incorporate new functions useful for population health. METHODS: We developed and tested methods to measure the completeness, timeliness and entropy of information. The new data quality methods were applied to over 100 million clinical messages received from emergency department information systems for use in public health syndromic surveillance systems. DISCUSSION: While completeness and entropy methods were implemented by the OHDSI community, timeliness was not adopted as its context did not fit with the existing OHDSI domains.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the effect that age at diagnosis has on the prognosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Korea using a CDM network database. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the K-CDM network database from 2005 to 2015. We transformed the electronic medical record into the CDM version 5.0 used in OHDSI. A worsened IBD prognosis was defined as the initiation of therapy with biologic agents, including infliximab and adalimumab. To evaluate the effect that age at diagnosis had on the prognosis of IBD, we divided the patients into an early-onset (EO) IBD group (age at diagnosis <40 years) and a late-onset (LO) IBD group (age at diagnosis >/=40 years) with the cutoff value of age at diagnosis as 40 years, which was calculated using the Youden index method. We then used the logrank test and Cox proportional hazards model to analyze the effect that age at diagnosis (EO group vs LO group) had on the prognosis in patients with IBD. RESULTS: A total of 3480 patients were enrolled. There was 2017 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 1463 with Crohn's disease (CD). The median follow up period was 109.5 weeks. The EO UC group was statistically significant and showed less event-free survival (ie, experiences of biologic agents) than the LO UC group (P<.001). In CD, the EO CD group showed less event-free survival (ie, experiences of biologic agents) than the LO CD group. In the Cox proportional hazard analysis, the odds ratio (OR) of the EO UC group on experiences of biologic agents compared with the LO UC group was 2.3 (95% CI 1.3-3.8, P=.002). The OR of the EO CD group on experiences of biologic agents compared with the LO CD group was 5.4 (95% CI 1.9-14.9, P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: The EO IBD group showed a worse prognosis than the LO IBD group in Korean patients with IBD.

In recent years, research networks, such as eMERGE, OHDSI and PCORnet, have been able to increase statistical power and population diversity by combining patient cohorts. These networks share phenotype algorithms that are executed at each participating site. Here we observe experiences with phenotype algorithm portability across seven research networks and propose a generalizable framework for phenotype algorithm portability. Several strategies exist to increase the portability of phenotype algorithms, reducing the implementation effort needed by each site. These include using a common data model, standardized representation of the phenotype algorithm logic, and technical solutions to facilitate federated execution of queries. Portability is achieved by tradeoffs across three domains: Data, Authoring and Implementation, and multiple approaches were observed in representing portable phenotype algorithms. Our proposed framework will help guide future research in operationalizing phenotype algorithm portability at scale.",Considerations for Improving the Portability of Electronic Health Record-Based Phenotype Algorithms.,"['*Algorithms', 'Biomedical Research', 'Common Data Elements', 'Computer Communication Networks', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Phenotype']",,

Supervised machine learning methods can be used to train phenotype classifiers in a high-throughput manner using imperfectly labeled data. We developed 10 phenotype classifiers using this approach and evaluated performance across multiple sites within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed classifiers using the Automated PHenotype Routine for Observational Definition, Identification, Training and Evaluation (APHRODITE) R-package, an open-source framework for learning phenotype classifiers using datasets in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. We labeled training data based on the presence of multiple mentions of disease-specific codes. Performance was evaluated on cohorts derived using rule-based definitions and real-world disease prevalence. Classifiers were developed and evaluated across 3 medical centers, including 1 international site. RESULTS: Compared to the multiple mentions labeling heuristic, classifiers showed a mean recall boost of 0.43 with a mean precision loss of 0.17. Performance decreased slightly when classifiers were shared across medical centers, with mean recall and precision decreasing by 0.08 and 0.01, respectively, at a site within the USA, and by 0.18 and 0.10, respectively, at an international site. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a high-throughput pipeline for constructing and sharing phenotype classifiers across sites within the OHDSI network using APHRODITE. Classifiers exhibit good portability between sites within the USA, however limited portability internationally, indicating that classifier generalizability may have geographic limitations, and, consequently, sharing the classifier-building recipe, rather than the pretrained classifiers, may be more useful for facilitating collaborative observational research.",Development and validation of phenotype classifiers across multiple sites in the observational health data sciences and informatics network.,"['Classification/methods', 'Data Science', 'Electronic Health Records/*classification', 'Humans', '*Medical Informatics', 'Observational Studies as Topic', '*Supervised Machine Learning']",,

METHODS: Five previously published prognostic models (ATRIA, CHADS(2), CHADS(2)VASC, Q-Stroke and Framingham) that predict future risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation were replicated using the OHDSI frameworks. A network study was run that enabled the five models to be externally validated across nine observational healthcare datasets spanning three countries and five independent sites. RESULTS: The five existing models were able to be integrated into the OHDSI framework for patient-level prediction and they obtained mean c-statistics ranging between 0.57-0.63 across the 6 databases with sufficient data to predict stroke within 1 year of initial atrial fibrillation diagnosis for females with atrial fibrillation. This was comparable with existing validation studies. The validation network study was run across nine datasets within 60 days once the models were replicated. An R package for the study was published at https://github.com/OHDSI/StudyProtocolSandbox/tree/master/ExistingStrokeRiskExternalValidation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the ability to scale up external validation of patient-level prediction models using a collaboration of researchers and a data standardization that enable models to be readily shared across data sites. External validation is necessary to understand the transportability or reproducibility of a prediction model, but without collaborative approaches it can take three or more years for a model to be validated by one independent researcher. In this paper we show it is possible to both scale-up and speed-up external validation by showing how validation can be done across multiple databases in less than 2 months. We recommend that researchers developing new prediction models use the OHDSI network to externally validate their models.",Feasibility and evaluation of a large-scale external validation approach for patient-level prediction in an international data network: validation of models predicting stroke in female patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.,"['*Atrial Fibrillation/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Stroke/diagnosis/epidemiology']",,

Evidence synthesis was performed to support Bradford Hill criteria in causality assessment. RESULTS: Evidence for strength of association, specificity, consistency, and analogy was found upon review of the case series. OHD was used to calculate incidence rates of colitis in new users of nintedanib across multiple populations, supportive of consistency, and further evidence for strength of association. Literature review identified support for biological plausibility and analogy. Signal assessment was supplemented with characterization of real-world users and exploration of potential risk factors using OHD. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated approach using two forms of real-world data, spontaneous reports of ADRs and data from observational databases allowed a comprehensive and efficient signal assessment of nintedanib and colitis. Further exploration of the complementary use of real-time OHD in signal assessment could inform more efficient approaches to current signal management practices.","Nintedanib and ischemic colitis: Signal assessment with the integrated use of two types of real-world evidence, spontaneous reports of suspected adverse drug reactions, and observational data from large health-care databases.","['Aged', 'Asia/epidemiology', 'Colitis, Ischemic/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/epidemiology', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'United States/epidemiology']",,

METHODS: The database establishment has started in 2017 by piloting the conversion of electronic health records of one hospital to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership's Common Data Model (OMOP). RESULTS: During the pilot phase we have faced several challenges such as limited contribution in providing data by local medical institution due to uncertainty about data governance, diversity of systems used by hospitals, inconsistent coding of medical information, and limited awareness about data structure from participating hospital. The pilot phase was completed in 2019 containing information about patient attributes, medical care, therapies, and other additional services for around 130 000 patients in Saudi Arabia. The majority of patients were below the age of 50 years (89%), and acute respiratory infections were the most frequent diagnosis. The data quality was acceptable and no major anomalies were detected during the conversion. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a successful creation of a pilot database using OHDSI Common Data Model. Our experience with the pilot database could be extended to other institutions to create a national dataset that could be used to generate real-world evidence.",Real-world data in Saudi Arabia: Current situation and challenges for regulatory decision-making.,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Databases, Factual/*statistics & numerical data', '*Decision Making', 'Electronic Health Records/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacoepidemiology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Pilot Projects', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Young Adult']",,

However, integration of HIE data into an EHR system is not yet fully adopted in clinical research. In addition, data quality should be verified for the secondary use of these data. Thus, the aims of this study were to convert referral documents in a Health Level 7 (HL7) clinical document architecture (CDA) to the common data model (CDM) to facilitate HIE data availability for longitudinal data analysis, and to identify data quality levels for application in future clinical studies. METHODS: A total of 21,492 referral CDA documents accumulated for over 10 years in a tertiary general hospital in South Korea were analyzed. To convert CDA documents to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM, processes such as CDA parsing, data cleaning, standard vocabulary mapping, CDA-to-CDM mapping, and CDM conversion were performed. The quality of CDM data was then evaluated using the Achilles Heel and visualized with the Achilles tool. RESULTS: Mapping five CDA elements (document header, problem, medication, laboratory, and procedure) into an OMOP CDM table resulted in population of 9 CDM tables (person, visit_occurrence, condition_occurrence, drug_exposure, measurement, observation, procedure_occurrence, care_site, and provider). Three CDM tables (drug_era, condition_era, and observation_period) were derived from the converted table. From vocabulary mapping codes in CDA documents according to domain, 98.6% of conditions, 68.8% of drugs, 35.7% of measurements, 100% of observation, and 56.4% of procedures were mapped as standard concepts. The conversion rates of the CDA to the OMOP CDM were 96.3% for conditions, 97.2% for drug exposure, 98.1% for procedure occurrence, 55.1% for measurements, and 100% for observation. CONCLUSIONS: We examined the possibility of CDM conversion by defining mapping rules for CDA-to-CDM conversion using the referral CDA documents collected from clinics in actual medical practice. Although mapping standard vocabulary for CDM conversion requires further improvement, the conversion could facilitate further research on the usage patterns of medical resources and referral patterns.",Converting clinical document architecture documents to the common data model for incorporating health information exchange data in observational health studies: CDA to CDM.,"['Electronic Health Records', '*Health Information Exchange', 'Humans', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Republic of Korea']",,

We also aimed to reveal whether CDM analysis was feasible and applicable to epilepsy research. We analyzed the treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy patients from our institute who underwent antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment for at least 2 years, using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM. Subgroup analysis was performed for generalized or focal epilepsy, varying age of epilepsy onset, and specific epilepsy syndromes. Changes in annual prescription patterns were also analyzed to reveal the different trends. We also calculated the proportion of drug-resistant epilepsy by applying the definition of seizure persistence after application of two ASMs for a sufficient period of time (more than 6 months). We identified 1,192 patients who underwent treatment for more than 2 years (mean +/- standard deviation: 6.5 +/- 3.2 years). In our pediatric epilepsy cohort, we identified 313 different treatment pathways. Drug resistance, calculated as the application of more than three ASMs during the first 2 years of treatment, was 23.8%. Treatment pathways and ASM resistance differed between subgroups of generalized vs. focal epilepsy, different onset age of epilepsy, and specific epilepsy syndromes. The frequency of ASM prescription was similar between onset groups of different ages; however, phenobarbital was frequently used in children with epilepsy onset < 4 years. Ninety-one of 344 cases of generalized epilepsy and 187 of 835 cases of focal epilepsy were classified as medically intractable epilepsy. The percentage of drug resistance was markedly different depending on the specific electro-clinical epilepsy syndrome [79.0% for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), 7.1% for childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and 9.0% for benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS)]. We could visualize the annual trend and changes of ASM prescription for pediatric epilepsy in our institute from 2004 to 2017. We revealed that CDM analysis was feasible and applicable for epilepsy research. The strengths and limitations of CDM analysis should be carefully considered when planning the analysis, result extraction, and interpretation of results.",Characterization of Anti-seizure Medication Treatment Pathways in Pediatric Epilepsy Using the Electronic Health Record-Based Common Data Model.,,,

However, integration of heterogeneous drug safety data sources and systems remains an impediment for effective pharmacovigilance studies. In an ongoing project, we have developed a next generation pharmacovigilance signal detection framework known as ADEpedia-on-OHDSI using the OMOP common data model (CDM). The objective of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework for integrating both spontaneous reporting data and EHR data for improved signal detection with a case study of immune-related adverse events. We first loaded the OMOP CDM with both recent and legacy FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) data (from the time period between Jan. 2004 and Dec. 2018). We also integrated the clinical data from the Mayo Clinic EHR system for six oncological immunotherapy drugs. We implemented a signal detection algorithm and compared the timelines of positive signals detected from both FAERS and EHR data. We found that the signals detected from EHRs are 4 months earlier than signals detected from FAERS database (depending on the signal detection methods used) for the ipilimumab-induced hypopituitarism.

More recently, real world data have been used for a wider range of research projects to support rapid, inexpensive clinical trials. Because the partial national lockdown in the United Kingdom due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in decreasing community disease incidence, much larger numbers of general practices are needed to deliver effective COVID-19 surveillance and contribute to in-pandemic clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this protocol is to describe the rapid design and development of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) and its first two platforms. The Surveillance Platform will provide extended primary care surveillance, while the Trials Platform is a streamlined clinical trials platform that will be integrated into routine primary care practice. METHODS: We will apply the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) metadata principles to a new, integrated digital health hub that will extract routinely collected general practice electronic health data for use in clinical trials and provide enhanced communicable disease surveillance. The hub will be findable through membership in Health Data Research UK and European metadata repositories. Accessibility through an online application system will provide access to study-ready data sets or developed custom data sets. Interoperability will be facilitated by fixed linkage to other key sources such as Hospital Episodes Statistics and the Office of National Statistics using pseudonymized data. All semantic descriptors (ie, ontologies) and code used for analysis will be made available to accelerate analyses. We will also make data available using common data models, starting with the US Food and Drug Administration Sentinel and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership approaches, to facilitate international studies. The Surveillance Platform will provide access to data for health protection and promotion work as authorized through agreements between Oxford, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and Public Health England. All studies using the Trials Platform will go through appropriate ethical and other regulatory approval processes. RESULTS: The hub will be a bottom-up, professionally led network that will provide benefits for member practices, our health service, and the population served. Data will only be used for SQUIRE (surveillance, quality improvement, research, and education) purposes. We have already received positive responses from practices, and the number of practices in the network has doubled to over 1150 since February 2020. COVID-19 surveillance has resulted in tripling of the number of virology sites to 293 (target 300), which has aided the collection of the largest ever weekly total of surveillance swabs in the United Kingdom as well as over 3000 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serology samples. Practices are recruiting to the PRINCIPLE (Platform Randomised trial of INterventions against COVID-19 In older PeopLE) trial, and these participants will be followed up through ORCHID. These initial outputs demonstrate the feasibility of ORCHID to provide an extended national digital health hub. CONCLUSIONS: ORCHID will provide equitable and innovative use of big data through a professionally led national primary care network and the application of FAIR principles. The secure data hub will host routinely collected general practice data linked to other key health care repositories for clinical trials and support enhanced in situ surveillance without always requiring large volume data extracts. ORCHID will support rapid data extraction, analysis, and dissemination with the aim of improving future research and development in general practice to positively impact patient care.

While these prediction models often produce promising results, a deployment in clinical settings is rarely pursued. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we demonstrate how prediction tools can be integrated generically into a clinical setting and provide an exemplary use case for predicting relapse risk in melanoma patients. METHODS: To make the decision support architecture independent of the electronic health record (EHR) and transferable to different hospital environments, it was based on the widely used Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) rather than on a proprietary EHR data structure. The usability of our exemplary implementation was evaluated by means of conducting user interviews including the thinking-aloud protocol and the system usability scale (SUS) questionnaire. RESULTS: An extract-transform-load process was developed to extract relevant clinical and molecular data from their original sources and map them to OMOP. Further, the OMOP WebAPI was adapted to retrieve all data for a single patient and transfer them into the decision support Web application for enabling physicians to easily consult the prediction service including monitoring of transferred data. The evaluation of the application resulted in a SUS score of 86.7. CONCLUSION: This work proposes an EHR-independent means of integrating prediction models for deployment in clinical settings, utilizing the OMOP CDM.

Age profiles varied across data sources. Prevalence of asthma ranged from 4% to 15%, diabetes from 13% to 43%, and hypertensive disorder from 24% to 70% across data sources. Between 14% and 33% were taking drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system in the 30 days prior to hospitalisation. Compared to 81,596 individuals hospitalised with influenza in 2014-19, patients admitted with COVID-19 were more typically male, younger, and healthier, with fewer comorbidities and lower medication use. Conclusions We provide a detailed characterisation of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Protecting groups known to be vulnerable to influenza is a useful starting point to minimize the number of hospital admissions needed for COVID-19. However, such strategies will also likely need to be broadened so as to reflect the particular characteristics of individuals hospitalised with COVID-19.","Deep phenotyping of 34,128 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and a comparison with 81,596 influenza patients in America, Europe and Asia: an international network study.",,,

In order to enable efficient drug safety alert generation in the French National Healthcare System database (SNDS), we assessed and calibrated empirically case-based designs to identify drug associated with UGIB risk. METHODS: All cases of UGIB were extracted from SNDS (2009-2014) using two definitions. Positive and negative drug controls were used to compare 196 self-controlled case series (SCCS), case-control (CC) and case-population (CP) design variants. Each variant was evaluated in a 1/10(th) population sample using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and mean square error (MSE). Parameters that had major impacts on results were identified through logistic regression. Optimal designs were replicated in the unsampled population. RESULTS: Using a specific UGIB definition, AUCs ranged from 0.64 to 0.80, 0.44 to 0.61 and 0.50 to 0.67, for SCCS, CC and CP, respectively. MSE ranged from 0.07 to 0.39, 0.83 to 1.33 and 1.96 to 4.6, respectively. Univariate regressions showed that high AUCs were achieved with SCCS with multiple drug adjustment and a 30-day risk window starting at exposure. The top-performing SCCS variant in the unsampled population yielded an AUC = 0.84 and MSE = 0.14, with 10/36 negative controls presenting significant estimates. CONCLUSIONS: SCCS adjusting for multiple drugs and using a 30-day risk window has the potential to generate UGIB-related alerts in the SNDS and hypotheses on its potential population impact.

As most of the immune checkpoint inhibitors are new to the market, it is important to conduct studies using real-world data sources to investigate their safety profiles. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to develop a framework for signal detection and filtration of novel irAEs for 6 Food and Drug Administration-approved immune checkpoint inhibitors. METHODS: In our framework, we first used the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) standardized in an Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) common data model (CDM) to collect immune checkpoint inhibitor-related event data and conducted irAE signal detection. OHDSI CDM is a standard-driven data model that focuses on transforming different databases into a common format and standardizing medical terms to a common representation. We then filtered those already known irAEs from drug labels and literature by using a customized text-mining pipeline based on clinical text analysis and knowledge extraction system with Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) as a dictionary. Finally, we classified the irAE detection results into three different categories to discover potentially new irAE signals. RESULTS: By our text-mining pipeline, 490 irAE terms were identified from drug labels, and 918 terms were identified from the literature. In addition, of the 94 positive signals detected using CDM-based FAERS, 53 signals (56%) were labeled signals, 10 (11%) were unlabeled published signals, and 31 (33%) were potentially new signals. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that our approach is effective for irAE signal detection and filtration. Moreover, our CDM-based framework could facilitate adverse drug events detection and filtration toward the goal of next-generation pharmacovigilance that seamlessly integrates electronic health record data for improved signal detection.",Detecting and Filtering Immune-Related Adverse Events Signal Based on Text Mining and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics Common Data Model: Framework Development Study.,,,

Epub 2020 May 30.,2020/06/13 06:00,International journal of medical informatics,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent years, an increasing number of clinical prediction models have been developed to serve clinical care. Establishing a data-driven prediction model based on large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data can provide a more empirical basis for clinical decision making. However, research on model generalization and continuous improvement is insufficiently focused, which also hinders the application and evaluation of prediction models in real clinical environments. Therefore, this study proposes a multicenter collaborative prediction model construction framework to build a prediction model with greater generalizability and continuous improvement capabilities while preserving patient data security and privacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a multicenter collaborative research network, such as the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI), a multicenter collaborative prediction model construction framework is proposed. Based on the idea of multi-source transfer learning, in each source hospital, a base classifier was trained according to the model research setting. Then, in the target hospital with missing calibration data, a prediction model was established through weighted integration of base classifiers from source hospitals based on the smoothness assumption. Moreover, a passive-aggressive online learning algorithm was used for continuous improvement of the prediction model, which can help to maintain a high predictive performance to provide reliable clinical decision-making abilities. To evaluate the proposed prediction model construction framework, a prototype system for colorectal cancer prognosis prediction was developed. To evaluate the performance of models, 70,906 patients were screened, including 70,090 from 5 US hospital-specific datasets and 816 from a Chinese hospital-specific dataset. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the estimated calibration index (ECI) were used to evaluate the discrimination and calibration of models. RESULTS: Regarding the colorectal cancer prognosis prediction in our prototype system, compared with the reference models, our model achieved a better performance in model calibration (ECI = 9.294 [9.146, 9.441]) and a similar ability in model discrimination (AUC = 0.783 [0.780, 0.786]). Furthermore, the online learning process provided in this study can continuously improve the performance of the prediction model when patient data with specified labels arrive (the AUC value increased from 0.709 to 0.715 and the ECI value decreased from 13.013 to 9.634 after 650 patient instances with specified labels from the Chinese hospital arrived), enabling the prediction model to maintain a good predictive performance during clinical application. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes and evaluates a multicenter collaborative prediction model construction framework that can support the construction of prediction models with better generalizability and continuous improvement capabilities without the need to aggregate multicenter patient-level data.",Establishment and evaluation of a multicenter collaborative prediction model construction framework supporting model generalization and continuous improvement: A pilot study.,"['*Algorithms', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve']",,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using patient-level data from a single site combined with only aggregated information from other sites, we constructed a surrogate likelihood function, approximating the Cox partial likelihood function obtained using patient-level data from all sites. By maximizing the surrogate likelihood function, each site obtained a local estimate of the model parameter, and the ODAC estimator was constructed as a weighted average of all the local estimates. We evaluated the performance of ODAC with (1) a simulation study and (2) a real-world use case study using 4 datasets from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network. RESULTS: On the one hand, our simulation study showed that ODAC provided estimates nearly the same as the estimator obtained by analyzing, in a single dataset, the combined patient-level data from all sites (ie, the pooled estimator). The relative bias was <0.1% across all scenarios. The accuracy of ODAC remained high across different sample sizes and event rates. On the other hand, the meta-analysis estimator, which was obtained by the inverse variance weighted average of the site-specific estimates, had substantial bias when the event rate is <5%, with the relative bias reaching 20% when the event rate is 1%. In the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network application, the ODAC estimates have a relative bias <5% for 15 out of 16 log hazard ratios, whereas the meta-analysis estimates had substantially higher bias than ODAC. CONCLUSIONS: ODAC is a privacy-preserving and noniterative method for implementing time-to-event analyses across multiple sites. It provides estimates on par with the pooled estimator and substantially outperforms the meta-analysis estimator when the event is uncommon, making it extremely suitable for studying rare events and diseases in a distributed manner.",Learning from local to global: An efficient distributed algorithm for modeling time-to-event data.,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Algorithms', 'Bias', 'Computer Simulation', 'Datasets as Topic', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Sample Size', 'Time Factors']",,

The primary outcome was the incidence of osteoporotic hip fracture, while secondary outcomes were vertebral fracture, atypical femoral fracture (AFF), osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), and esophageal cancer. We used propensity score trimming and stratification based on an expansive propensity score model with all pre-treatment patient characteritistcs. We accounted for unmeasured confounding using negative control outcomes to estimate and adjust for residual systematic bias in each data source. We identified 283,586 alendronate patients and 40,463 raloxifene patients.

However, real-world use of colonoscopy in older populations is rarely evaluated using Korean databases. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of individuals aged over 20 years between 2012 and 2017. We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment-National Patient Samples database, previously converted to the standardized Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model. The use of diagnostic colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy was evaluated, stratified by age group and sex. RESULTS: During the study period, we captured data from the database on 240,406 patients who underwent diagnostic colonoscopy and 88,984 who underwent colonoscopic polypectomy. During the study period, use of diagnostic colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy steadily increased, but both procedures were most significantly increased in the 65- to 85-year group compared to other age groups (p < 0.05). Average ages for both procedures significantly increased in the most recent 3 years (p < 0.05). Polypectomy rates for men plateaued in the 50- to 64-year age group, but rates for women steadily increased up to the 65- to 85-year group. Polypectomy rates were higher for men than for women in all index years. CONCLUSIONS: The use of diagnostic colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy significantly increased in the 65- to 85-year age group. Our findings suggest that more available colonoscopy resources should be allocated to older populations, considering the aging society in Asian countries.",Real-World Use of Colonoscopy in an Older Population: A Nationwide Standard Cohort Study Using a Common Data Model.,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colonoscopy/*economics/*trends', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,

We hypothesize that understanding longitudinal disease characteristics can lead to more timely intervention and improve clinical outcomes. As a first step, we developed an efficient and easy-to-install toolkit, the Time-based Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (TECI), which pre-calculates time-based Elixhauser comorbidities and can be extended to common data models (CDMs). METHODS: A Structured Query Language (SQL)-based toolkit, TECI, was built to pre-calculate time-specific Elixhauser comorbidity indices using data from a clinical data repository (CDR). Then it was extended to the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (I2B2) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs. RESULTS: At the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS), the TECI toolkit was successfully installed to compute the indices from CDR data, and the scores were integrated into the I2B2 and OMOP CDMs. Comorbidity scores calculated by TECI were validated against: scores available in the 2015 quarter 1-3 Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) and scores calculated using the comorbidities using a previously validated algorithm on the 2015 quarter 4 NRD. Furthermore, TECI identified 18,846 UAMS patients that had changes in comorbidity scores over time (year 2013 to 2019). Comorbidities for a random sample of patients were independently reviewed, and in all cases, the results were found to be 100% accurate. CONCLUSION: TECI facilitates the study of comorbidities within a time-dependent context, allowing better understanding of disease associations and trajectories, which has the potential to improve clinical outcomes.",Toolkit to Compute Time-Based Elixhauser Comorbidity Indices and Extension to Common Data Models.,,,

METHOD: A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting between the two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selected three best papers. RESULTS: Among the 517 papers, published in 2019, returned by the search, that were in the scope of the various areas of CRI, the full review process selected three best papers. The first best paper describes the use of a homomorphic encryption technique to enable federated analysis of real-world data while complying more easily with data protection requirements. The authors of the second best paper demonstrate the evidence value of federated data networks reporting a large real world data study related to the first line treatment for hypertension. The third best paper reports the migration of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database to the OMOP common data model. This work opens the combined analysis of both spontaneous reporting system and electronic health record (EHR) data for pharmacovigilance. CONCLUSIONS: The most significant research efforts in the CRI field are currently focusing on real world evidence generation and especially the reuse of EHR data. With the progress achieved this year in the areas of phenotyping, data integration, semantic interoperability, and data quality assessment, real world data is becoming more accessible and reusable. High quality data sets are key assets not only for large scale observational studies or for changing the way clinical trials are conducted but also for developing or evaluating artificial intelligence algorithms guiding clinical decision for more personalized care. And lastly, security and confidentiality, ethical and regulatory issues, and more generally speaking data governance are still active research areas this year.",Clinical Research Informatics.,"['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems', '*Biomedical Research', '*Computer Security', 'Data Accuracy', 'Data Management', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/drug therapy', '*Medical Informatics', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Precision Medicine', 'Treatment Outcome']",,

Contributors utilized the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) or Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) platforms to map to a common data model. The group focused on temporal changes in key laboratory test values. Harmonized data were analyzed locally and converted to a shared aggregate form for rapid analysis and visualization of regional differences and global commonalities. Data covered 27,584 COVID-19 cases with 187,802 laboratory tests. Case counts and laboratory trajectories were concordant with existing literature. Laboratory tests at the time of diagnosis showed hospital-level differences equivalent to country-level variation across the consortium partners.

Epub 2020 Aug 21.,2020/09/01 06:00,The Lancet. Rheumatology,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, has received much negative publicity for adverse events associated with its authorisation for emergency use to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, to determine the risk associated with its use in routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: In this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 18 years or older and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared with those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days, with 16 severe adverse events studied. Self-controlled case series were done to further establish safety in wider populations, and included all users of hydroxychloroquine regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication. Separately, severe adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (HRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where the I (2) value was less than 0.4. FINDINGS: The study included 956 374 users of hydroxychloroquine, 310 350 users of sulfasalazine, 323 122 users of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 351 956 users of hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin. No excess risk of severe adverse events was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. Self-controlled case series confirmed these findings. However, long-term use of hydroxychloroquine appeared to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.12-2.44]). Addition of azithromycin appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 2.19 [95% CI 1.22-3.95]), chest pain or angina (1.15 [1.05-1.26]), and heart failure (1.22 [1.02-1.45]). INTERPRETATION: Hydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in the long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality even in the short term. We call for careful consideration of the benefit-risk trade-off when counselling those on hydroxychloroquine treatment.

An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) will be valuable to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. To this end, this study aims at adapting the existing CLAMP natural language processing tool to quickly build COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract COVID-19 signs/symptoms and their 8 attributes (body location, severity, temporal expression, subject, condition, uncertainty, negation, and course) from clinical text. The extracted information is also mapped to standard concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. A hybrid approach of combining deep learning-based models, curated lexicons, and pattern-based rules was applied to quickly build the COVID-19 SignSym from CLAMP, with optimized performance. Our extensive evaluation using 3 external sites with clinical notes of COVID-19 patients, as well as the online medical dialogues of COVID-19, shows COVID-19 SignSym can achieve high performance across data sources. The workflow used for this study can be generalized to other use cases, where existing clinical natural language processing tools need to be customized for specific information needs within a short time.

However, many claim such data cannot be used to estimate causal treatment effects because of the potential for observational study bias; for example, due to residual confounding. Other concerns include P hacking and publication bias. In response, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics international collaborative launched the Large-scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation across a Network of Databases (LEGEND) research initiative. Its mission is to generate evidence on the effects of medical interventions using observational health-care databases while addressing the aforementioned concerns by following a recently proposed paradigm. We define 10 principles of LEGEND that enshrine this new paradigm, prescribing the generation and dissemination of evidence on many research questions at once; for example, comparing all treatments for a disease for many outcomes, thus preventing publication bias. These questions are answered using a prespecified and systematic approach, avoiding P hacking. Best-practice statistical methods address measured confounding, and control questions (research questions where the answer is known) quantify potential residual bias. Finally, the evidence is generated in a network of databases to assess consistency by sharing open-source analytics code to enhance transparency and reproducibility, but without sharing patient-level information. Here we detail the LEGEND principles and provide a generic overview of a LEGEND study. Our companion paper highlights an example study on the effects of hypertension treatments, and evaluates the internal and external validity of the evidence we generate.",Principles of Large-scale Evidence Generation and Evaluation across a Network of Databases (LEGEND).,"['Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Computer Communication Networks', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', '*Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/*drug therapy', '*Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Observation', 'Propensity Score', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,

We compare deep learning and machine learning models to a baseline logistic regression using only 'known' risk factors in predicting incident myocardial infarction (MI) from harmonized EHR data. METHODS: Large-scale case-control study with outcome of 6-month incident MI, conducted using the top 800, from an initial 52 k procedures, diagnoses, and medications within the UCHealth system, harmonized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model, performed on 2.27 million patients. We compared several over- and under- sampling techniques to address the imbalance in the dataset. We compared regularized logistics regression, random forest, boosted gradient machines, and shallow and deep neural networks. A baseline model for comparison was a logistic regression using a limited set of 'known' risk factors for MI. Hyper-parameters were identified using 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Twenty thousand Five hundred and ninety-one patients were diagnosed with MI compared with 2.25 million who did not. A deep neural network with random undersampling provided superior classification compared with other methods. However, the benefit of the deep neural network was only moderate, showing an F1 Score of 0.092 and AUC of 0.835, compared to a logistic regression model using only 'known' risk factors. Calibration for all models was poor despite adequate discrimination, due to overfitting from low frequency of the event of interest.

Natural language processing techniques have shown promise in their capability to extract the information embedded in unstructured clinical data, and information retrieval techniques provide flexible and scalable solutions that can augment natural language processing systems for retrieving and ranking relevant records. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present the implementation of a cohort retrieval system that can execute textual cohort selection queries on both structured data and unstructured text-Cohort Retrieval Enhanced by Analysis of Text from Electronic Health Records (CREATE). METHODS: CREATE is a proof-of-concept system that leverages a combination of structured queries and information retrieval techniques on natural language processing results to improve cohort retrieval performance using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model to enhance model portability. The natural language processing component was used to extract common data model concepts from textual queries. We designed a hierarchical index to support the common data model concept search utilizing information retrieval techniques and frameworks. RESULTS: Our case study on 5 cohort identification queries, evaluated using the precision at 5 information retrieval metric at both the patient-level and document-level, demonstrates that CREATE achieves a mean precision at 5 of 0.90, which outperforms systems using only structured data or only unstructured text with mean precision at 5 values of 0.54 and 0.74, respectively.

The current practice is to analyze the outcomes based on patient level data submitted to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). Augmenting the UNOS data with other sources such as the electronic health record will enrich the outcomes analysis, for which a common data model (CDM) can be a helpful tool for transforming heterogeneous source data into a uniform format. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of representing concepts from the UNOS transplant registry forms with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM vocabulary to understand the content coverage of OMOP vocabulary on transplant-specific concepts. METHODS: Two annotators manually mapped a total of 3,571 unique concepts extracted from the UNOS registry forms to concepts in the OMOP vocabulary. Concept mappings were evaluated by (1) examining the agreement among the initial two annotators and (2) investigating the number of UNOS concepts not mapped to a concept in the OMOP vocabulary and then classifying them. A subset of mappings was validated by clinicians. RESULTS: There was a substantial agreement between annotators with a kappa score of 0.71. We found that 55.5% of UNOS concepts could not be represented with OMOP standard concepts. The majority of unmapped UNOS concepts were categorized into transplant, measurement, condition, and procedure concepts. CONCLUSION: We identified categories of unmapped concepts and found that some transplant-specific concepts do not exist in the OMOP vocabulary. We suggest that adding these missing concepts to OMOP would facilitate further research in the transplant domain.",Content Coverage Evaluation of the OMOP Vocabulary on the Transplant Domain Focusing on Concepts Relevant for Kidney Transplant Outcomes Analysis.,"['Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Medical Informatics/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Vocabulary, Controlled']",,

Despite recent progress, current phenotyping approaches are manual, time-consuming, error-prone, and platform-specific. This results in duplication of effort and highly variable results across systems and institutions, and is not scalable or portable. In this work, we investigate how the nascent Clinical Quality Language (CQL) can address these issues and enable high-throughput, cross-platform phenotyping. METHODS: We selected a clinically validated heart failure (HF) phenotype definition and translated it into CQL, then developed a CQL execution engine to integrate with the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) platform. We executed the phenotype definition at two large academic medical centers, Northwestern Medicine and Weill Cornell Medicine, and conducted results verification (n = 100) to determine precision and recall. We additionally executed the same phenotype definition against two different data platforms, OHDSI and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), using the same underlying dataset and compared the results. RESULTS: CQL is expressive enough to represent the HF phenotype definition, including Boolean and aggregate operators, and temporal relationships between data elements. The language design also enabled the implementation of a custom execution engine with relative ease, and results verification at both sites revealed that precision and recall were both 100%. Cross-platform execution resulted in identical patient cohorts generated by both data platforms. CONCLUSIONS: CQL supports the representation of arbitrarily complex phenotype definitions, and our execution engine implementation demonstrated cross-platform execution against two widely used clinical data platforms. The language thus has the potential to help address current limitations with portability in EHR-driven phenotyping and scale in learning health systems.",Toward cross-platform electronic health record-driven phenotyping using Clinical Quality Language.,,,

Case-based designs were empirically assessed and calibrated in the French National claims database (SNDS), aiming to identify the optimum design for drug safety alert generation associated with ALI. METHODS: All cases of ALI were extracted from SNDS (2009-2014) using specific and sensitive definitions. Positive and negative drug controls were used to compare 196 self-controlled case series (SCCS), case-control (CC), and case-population (CP) design variants, using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), mean square error (MSE) and coverage probability. Parameters that had major impacts on results were identified through logistic regression. RESULTS: Using a specific ALI definition, AUCs ranged from 0.78 to 0.94, 0.64 to 0.92 and 0.48 to 0.85, for SCCS, CC and CP, respectively. MSE ranged from 0.12 to 0.40, 0.22 to 0.39 and 1.03 to 5.29, respectively. Variants adjusting for multiple drug use had higher coverage probabilities. Univariate regressions showed that high AUCs were achieved with SCCS using exposed time as the risk window. The top SCCS variant yielded an AUC = 0.93 and MSE = 0.22 and coverage = 86%, with 1/7 negative and 13/18 positive controls presenting significant estimates. CONCLUSIONS: SCCS adjusting for multiple drugs and using exposed time as the risk window performed best in generating ALI-related drug safety alert and providing estimates of the magnitude of the risk.

The benefits and risks associated with ticagrelor vs clopidogrel in routine practice merits attention. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of ticagrelor vs clopidogrel with ischemic and hemorrhagic events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ACS in clinical practice. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with ACS who underwent PCI and received ticagrelor or clopidogrel was conducted using 2 United States electronic health record-based databases and 1 nationwide South Korean database from November 2011 to March 2019. Patients were matched using a large-scale propensity score algorithm, and the date of final follow-up was March 2019. EXPOSURES: Ticagrelor vs clopidogrel. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was net adverse clinical events (NACE) at 12 months, composed of ischemic events (recurrent myocardial infarction, revascularization, or ischemic stroke) and hemorrhagic events (hemorrhagic stroke or gastrointestinal bleeding). Secondary outcomes included NACE or mortality, all-cause mortality, ischemic events, hemorrhagic events, individual components of the primary outcome, and dyspnea at 12 months. The database-level hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled to calculate summary HRs by random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: After propensity score matching among 31 290 propensity-matched pairs (median age group, 60-64 years; 29.3% women), 95.5% of patients took aspirin together with ticagrelor or clopidogrel. The 1-year risk of NACE was not significantly different between ticagrelor and clopidogrel (15.1% [3484/23 116 person-years] vs 14.6% [3290/22 587 person-years]; summary HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.00-1.10]; P = .06). There was also no significant difference in the risk of all-cause mortality (2.0% for ticagrelor vs 2.1% for clopidogrel; summary HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.81-1.16]; P = .74) or ischemic events (13.5% for ticagrelor vs 13.4% for clopidogrel; summary HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.98-1.08]; P = .32). The risks of hemorrhagic events (2.1% for ticagrelor vs 1.6% for clopidogrel; summary HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.13-1.61]; P = .001) and dyspnea (27.3% for ticagrelor vs 22.6% for clopidogrel; summary HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.17-1.26]; P < .001) were significantly higher in the ticagrelor group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with ACS who underwent PCI in routine clinical practice, ticagrelor, compared with clopidogrel, was not associated with significant difference in the risk of NACE at 12 months. Because the possibility of unmeasured confounders cannot be excluded, further research is needed to determine whether ticagrelor is more effective than clopidogrel in this setting.",Association of Ticagrelor vs Clopidogrel With Net Adverse Clinical Events in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,"['Acute Coronary Syndrome/mortality/*surgery', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Aspirin/administration & dosage', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Clopidogrel/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Dyspnea/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Ischemia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction/epidemiology', 'Network Meta-Analysis', '*Percutaneous Coronary Intervention', 'Propensity Score', 'Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Republic of Korea', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stroke/epidemiology', 'Ticagrelor/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'United States']",,

We developed an open-source software for spatial epidemiological analysis and demonstrated its applicability and quality. METHODS: Based on standardized geocode and observational health data, the Application of Epidemiological Geographic Information System (AEGIS) provides two spatial analysis methods: disease mapping and detecting clustered medical conditions and outcomes. The AEGIS assesses the geographical distribution of incidences and health outcomes in Korea and the United States, specifically incidence of cancers and their mortality rates, endemic malarial areas, and heart diseases (only the United States). RESULTS: The AEGIS-generated spatial distribution of incident cancer in Korea was consistent with previous reports. The incidence of liver cancer in women with the highest Moran's I (0.44; p < 0.001) was 17.4 (10.3-26.9). The malarial endemic cluster was identified in Paju-si, Korea (p < 0.001). When the AEGIS was applied to the database of the United States, a heart disease cluster was appropriately identified (p < 0.001).

The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (CDM), defined by the nonprofit organization Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, has been gaining attention for its use in the analysis of patient-level clinical data obtained from various medical institutions. When analyzing such data in a public environment such as a cloud-computing system, an appropriate de-identification strategy is required to protect patient privacy. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes and evaluates a de-identification strategy that is comprised of several rules along with privacy models such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness. The proposed strategy was evaluated using the actual CDM database. METHODS: The CDM database used in this study was constructed by the Anam Hospital of Korea University. Analysis and evaluation were performed using the ARX anonymizing framework in combination with the k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness privacy models. RESULTS: The CDM database, which was constructed according to the rules established by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, exhibited a low risk of re-identification: The highest re-identifiable record rate (11.3%) in the dataset was exhibited by the DRUG_EXPOSURE table, with a re-identification success rate of 0.03%. However, because all tables include at least one ""highest risk"" value of 100%, suitable anonymizing techniques are required; moreover, the CDM database preserves the ""source values"" (raw data), a combination of which could increase the risk of re-identification. Therefore, this study proposes an enhanced strategy to de-identify the source values to significantly reduce not only the highest risk in the k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness privacy models but also the overall possibility of re-identification.

The prediction outcomes were all-cause mortality, 8 leading causes of death in South Korea, and other causes. The clinical data of study populations were extracted from the national claims (n = 174 747) and electronic health records (n = 729 065) and were used for model development and external validation. Moreover, we imputed the cause of death from the data of 3 US claims databases (n = 994 518, 995 372, and 407 604, respectively). All databases were formatted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. RESULTS: The generalized area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the model predicting the cause of death within 60 days was 0.9511. Moreover, the AUROC of the external validation was 0.8887. Among the causes of death imputed in the Medicare Supplemental database, 11.32% of deaths were due to malignant neoplastic disease. DISCUSSION: This study showed the potential of machine-learning models as a new alternative to address the lack of access to cause-of-death data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: On June 18, 2020, we identified frequently used eligibility criteria from all the interventional COVID-19 trials in ClinicalTrials.gov (n = 288), including age, pregnancy, oxygen saturation, alanine/aspartate aminotransferase, platelets, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. We applied the frequently used criteria to the EHR data of COVID-19 patients in Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) (March 2020-June 2020) and evaluated their impact on patient accrual and the occurrence of a composite endpoint of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and in-hospital death. RESULTS: There were 3251 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the CUIMC EHR included in the analysis. The median follow-up period was 10 days (interquartile range 4-28 days). The composite events occurred in 18.1% (n = 587) of the COVID-19 cohort during the follow-up. In a hypothetical trial with common eligibility criteria, 33.6% (690/2051) were eligible among patients with evaluable data and 22.2% (153/690) had the composite event. DISCUSSION: By adjusting the thresholds of common eligibility criteria based on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients, we could observe more composite events from fewer patients. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the potential of using the EHR data of COVID-19 patients to inform the selection of eligibility criteria and their thresholds, supporting data-driven optimization of participant selection towards improved statistical power of COVID-19 trials.",Towards clinical data-driven eligibility criteria optimization for interventional COVID-19 clinical trials.,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'COVID-19/mortality/*therapy', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Electronic Health Records', '*Eligibility Determination', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen/blood', 'Patient Selection', 'Pregnancy', 'Research Design', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Tracheostomy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,

DESIGN: A network cohort study. SETTING: Seven databases from the United States containing routinely-collected patient data: HealthVerity, Premier, IQVIA Hospital CDM, IQVIA Open Claims, Optum EHR, Optum SES, and VA-OMOP. PATIENTS: Patients hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis or a positive test result for COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Dialysis, tracheostomy, and ECMO. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 842,928 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included (22,887 from HealthVerity, 77,853 from IQVIA Hospital CDM, 533,997 from IQVIA Open Claims, 36,717 from Optum EHR, 4,336 from OPTUM SES, 156,187 from Premier, and 10,951 from VA-OMOP). Across the six databases, 35,192 (4.17% [95% CI: 4.13% to 4.22%]) patients received dialysis, 6,950 (0.82% [0.81% to 0.84%]) had a tracheostomy, and 1,568 (0.19% [95% CI: 0.18% to 0.20%]) patients underwent ECMO over the 30 days following hospitalization. Use of ECMO was more common among patients who were younger, male, and with fewer comorbidities. Tracheostomy was broadly used for a similar proportion of patients regardless of age, sex, or comorbidity. While dialysis was generally used for a similar proportion among younger and older patients, it was more frequent among male patients and among those with chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: Use of dialysis among those hospitalized with COVID-19 is high at around 4%. Although less than one percent of patients undergo tracheostomy and ECMO, the absolute numbers of patients who have undergone these interventions is substantial.","Use of dialysis, tracheostomy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation among 842,928 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States.",,,

An analysis of pathology reports is required to establish fundamental information infrastructure for data-driven colon cancer research. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM is used in distributed research networks for clinical data; however, it requires conversion of free text-based pathology reports into the CDM's format. There are few use cases of representing cancer data in CDM. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to construct a CDM database of colon cancer-related pathology with natural language processing (NLP) for a research platform that can utilize both clinical and omics data. The essential text entities from the pathology reports are extracted, standardized, and converted to the OMOP CDM format in order to utilize the pathology data in cancer research. METHODS: We extracted clinical text entities, mapped them to the standard concepts in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics vocabularies, and built databases and defined relations for the CDM tables. Major clinical entities were extracted through NLP on pathology reports of surgical specimens, immunohistochemical studies, and molecular studies of colon cancer patients at a tertiary general hospital in South Korea. Items were extracted from each report using regular expressions in Python. Unstructured data, such as text that does not have a pattern, were handled with expert advice by adding regular expression rules. Our own dictionary was used for normalization and standardization to deal with biomarker and gene names and other ungrammatical expressions. The extracted clinical and genetic information was mapped to the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes databases and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) standard terminologies recommended by the OMOP CDM. The database-table relationships were newly defined through SNOMED standard terminology concepts. The standardized data were inserted into the CDM tables. For evaluation, 100 reports were randomly selected and independently annotated by a medical informatics expert and a nurse. RESULTS: We examined and standardized 1848 immunohistochemical study reports, 3890 molecular study reports, and 12,352 pathology reports of surgical specimens (from 2017 to 2018). The constructed and updated database contained the following extracted colorectal entities: (1) NOTE_NLP, (2) MEASUREMENT, (3) CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, (4) SPECIMEN, and (5) FACT_RELATIONSHIP of specimen with condition and measurement. CONCLUSIONS: This study aimed to prepare CDM data for a research platform to take advantage of all omics clinical and patient data at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for colon cancer pathology. A more sophisticated preparation of the pathology data is needed for further research on cancer genomics, and various types of text narratives are the next target for additional research on the use of data in the CDM.",Transformation of Pathology Reports Into the Common Data Model With Oncology Module: Use Case for Colon Cancer.,"['Colonic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records/*standards', 'Humans', 'Medical Informatics/*methods', 'Medical Oncology/*methods']",,

Common data models and federated data networks offer a potential solution to many of these problems. The open-source Observational and Medical Outcomes Partnerships (OMOP) common data model standardises the structure, format, and terminologies of otherwise disparate datasets, enabling the execution of common analytical code across a federated data network in which only code and aggregate results are shared. While common data models are increasingly used in regulatory decision making, relatively little attention has been given to their use in health technology assessment (HTA). We show that the common data model has the potential to facilitate access to relevant data, enable multidatabase studies to enhance statistical power and transfer results across populations and settings to meet the needs of local HTA decision makers, and validate findings. The use of open-source and standardised analytics improves transparency and reduces coding errors, thereby increasing confidence in the results. Further engagement from the HTA community is required to inform the appropriate standards for mapping data to the common data model and to design tools that can support evidence generation and decision making.","Common Problems, Common Data Model Solutions: Evidence Generation for Health Technology Assessment.","['Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', '*Technology Assessment, Biomedical']",,

Digital health,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been postulated to affect susceptibility to COVID-19. Observational studies so far have lacked rigorous ascertainment adjustment and international generalisability. We aimed to determine whether use of ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. METHODS: In this international, open science, cohort analysis, we used electronic health records from Spain (Information Systems for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP]) and the USA (Columbia University Irving Medical Center data warehouse [CUIMC] and Department of Veterans Affairs Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [VA-OMOP]) to identify patients aged 18 years or older with at least one prescription for ACEIs and ARBs (target cohort) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics (THZs; comparator cohort) between Nov 1, 2019, and Jan 31, 2020. Users were defined separately as receiving either monotherapy with these four drug classes, or monotherapy or combination therapy (combination use) with other antihypertensive medications. We assessed four outcomes: COVID-19 diagnosis; hospital admission with COVID-19; hospital admission with pneumonia; and hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis. We built large-scale propensity score methods derived through a data-driven approach and negative control experiments across ten pairwise comparisons, with results meta-analysed to generate 1280 study effects. For each study effect, we did negative control outcome experiments using a possible 123 controls identified through a data-rich algorithm. This process used a set of predefined baseline patient characteristics to provide the most accurate prediction of treatment and balance among patient cohorts across characteristics. The study is registered with the EU Post-Authorisation Studies register, EUPAS35296. FINDINGS: Among 1 355 349 antihypertensive users (363 785 ACEI or ARB monotherapy users, 248 915 CCB or THZ monotherapy users, 711 799 ACEI or ARB combination users, and 473 076 CCB or THZ combination users) included in analyses, no association was observed between COVID-19 diagnosis and exposure to ACEI or ARB monotherapy versus CCB or THZ monotherapy (calibrated hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.84-1.14) or combination use exposure (1.01, 0.90-1.15). ACEIs alone similarly showed no relative risk difference when compared with CCB or THZ monotherapy (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68-1.21; with heterogeneity of >40%) or combination use (0.95, 0.83-1.07). Directly comparing ACEIs with ARBs demonstrated a moderately lower risk with ACEIs, which was significant with combination use (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.99) and non-significant for monotherapy (0.85, 0.69-1.05). We observed no significant difference between drug classes for risk of hospital admission with COVID-19, hospital admission with pneumonia, or hospital admission with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, or sepsis across all comparisons. INTERPRETATION: No clinically significant increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital admission-related outcomes associated with ACEI or ARB use was observed, suggesting users should not discontinue or change their treatment to decrease their risk of COVID-19.

However, limited prior studies raise concerns about the real-world performance of the statistical and epidemiological methods that are used. We present the ""OHDSI Methods Benchmark"" that aims to evaluate the performance of effect estimation methods on real data. The benchmark comprises a gold standard, a set of metrics, and a set of open source software tools. The gold standard is a collection of real negative controls (drug-outcome pairs where no causal effect appears to exist) and synthetic positive controls (drug-outcome pairs that augment negative controls with simulated causal effects). We apply the benchmark using four large healthcare databases to evaluate methods commonly used in practice: the new-user cohort, self-controlled cohort, case-control, case-crossover, and self-controlled case series designs. The results confirm the concerns about these methods, showing that for most methods the operating characteristics deviate considerably from nominal levels. For example, in most contexts, only half of the 95% confidence intervals we calculated contain the corresponding true effect size. We previously developed an ""empirical calibration"" procedure to restore these characteristics and we also evaluate this procedure. While no one method dominates, self-controlled methods such as the empirically calibrated self-controlled case series perform well across a wide range of scenarios.",How Confident Are We about Observational Findings in Healthcare: A Benchmark Study.,,,

We aimed to study whether there is risk of incident depression, suicidal ideation or psychosis associated with HCQ as used for RA. METHODS: We performed a new-user cohort study using claims and electronic medical records from 10 sources and 3 countries (Germany, UK and USA). RA patients >/=18 years of age and initiating HCQ were compared with those initiating SSZ (active comparator) and followed up in the short (30 days) and long term (on treatment). Study outcomes included depression, suicide/suicidal ideation and hospitalization for psychosis. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate database-specific calibrated hazard ratios (HRs), with estimates pooled where I2 <40%. RESULTS: A total of 918 144 and 290 383 users of HCQ and SSZ, respectively, were included. No consistent risk of psychiatric events was observed with short-term HCQ (compared with SSZ) use, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.96 (95% CI 0.79, 1.16) for depression, 0.94 (95% CI 0.49, 1.77) for suicide/suicidal ideation and 1.03 (95% CI 0.66, 1.60) for psychosis. No consistent long-term risk was seen, with meta-analytic HRs of 0.94 (95% CI 0.71, 1.26) for depression, 0.77 (95% CI 0.56, 1.07) for suicide/suicidal ideation and 0.99 (95% CI 0.72, 1.35) for psychosis. CONCLUSION: HCQ as used to treat RA does not appear to increase the risk of depression, suicide/suicidal ideation or psychosis compared with SSZ. No effects were seen in the short or long term. Use at a higher dose or for different indications needs further investigation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered with EU PAS (reference no.

METHODS: In this retrospective, observational cohort study performed between 2012 and 2017, serious complications of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, and colonoscopic polypectomy were compared between patients according to age (>/=65 years vs 18-64 years). We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment-National Patient Samples database, previously converted to the standardized Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model. Serious complications within 30 days of the procedure included both GI complications (bleeding and perforation) and non-GI complications (cerebrovascular accident [CVA], acute myocardial infarction [AMI], congestive heart failure [CHF], and death). RESULTS: A total of 387,647 patients who underwent EGD, 241,094 who underwent colonoscopy, and 89,059 who underwent colonoscopic polypectomy were assessed as part of this investigation. During the study period, endoscopic procedures in the older group steadily increased in number in all endoscopy groups (all p<0.001). Further, pooled complication rates of bleeding, CVA, AMI, CHF, and death were approximately three times higher among older patients who underwent EGD or colonoscopy. Moreover, pooled complication rates of CVA, AMI, CHF, and death were approximately 2.2 to 5.0 times higher among older patients who underwent colonoscopic polypectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients experienced approximately three times more GI and non-GI complications after EGD or colonoscopy than young patients. Physicians should pay attention to the potential risks of GI endoscopy in elderly patients.",Gastrointestinal and Nongastrointestinal Complications of Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and Colonoscopy in the Real World: A Nationwide Standard Cohort Using the Common Data Model Database.,"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', '*Colonoscopy/adverse effects', 'Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal', 'Humans', '*Intestinal Polyps', 'Retrospective Studies']",,

Prior studies show gaps in data collected from patient surveys and electronic health records (EHRs). The All of Us Research Program collects family history from participants via surveys and EHRs. This Demonstration Project aims to evaluate availability of family health history information within the publicly available data from All of Us and to characterize the data from both sources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surveys were completed by participants on an electronic portal. EHR data was mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership data model. We used descriptive statistics to perform exploratory analysis of the data, including evaluating a list of medically actionable genetic disorders. We performed a subanalysis on participants who had both survey and EHR data. RESULTS: There were 54 872 participants with family history data. Of those, 26% had EHR data only, 63% had survey only, and 10.5% had data from both sources. There were 35 217 participants with reported family history of a medically actionable genetic disorder (9% from EHR only, 89% from surveys, and 2% from both). In the subanalysis, we found inconsistencies between the surveys and EHRs. More details came from surveys. When both mentioned a similar disease, the source of truth was unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Compiling data from both surveys and EHR can provide a more comprehensive source for family health history, but informatics challenges and opportunities exist.

treatments are from single health systems or focused on one domain. Here we report the creation of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a centralized, harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record repository that is the largest, most representative U.S. cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls to date. This multi-center dataset supports robust evidence-based development of predictive and diagnostic tools and informs critical care and policy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In a retrospective cohort study of 1,926,526 patients from 34 medical centers nationwide, we stratified patients using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographics; we then evaluated differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression. We established vital signs and laboratory values among COVID-19 patients with different severities, providing the foundation for predictive analytics. The cohort included 174,568 adults with severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PCR >99% or antigen <1%) as well as 1,133,848 adult patients that served as lab-negative controls. Among 32,472 hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March/April 2020 to 8.6% in September/October 2020 (p = 0.002 monthly trend). In a multivariable logistic regression model, age, male sex, liver disease, dementia, African-American and Asian race, and obesity were independently associated with higher clinical severity. To demonstrate the utility of the N3C cohort for analytics, we used machine learning (ML) to predict clinical severity and risk factors over time. Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, we predicted a severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) using random forest and XGBoost models (AUROC 0.86 and 0.87 respectively) that were stable over time. The most powerful predictors in these models are patient age and widely available vital sign and laboratory values. The established expected trajectories for many vital signs and laboratory values among patients with different clinical severities validates observations from smaller studies, and provides comprehensive insight into COVID-19 characterization in U.S. patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of an ongoing longitudinal observational study of patients seen in diverse clinical settings and geographical regions and is the largest COVID-19 cohort in the United States. Such data are the foundation for ML models that can be the basis for generalizable clinical decision support tools. The N3C Data Enclave is unique in providing transparent, reproducible, easily shared, versioned, and fully auditable data and analytic provenance for national-scale patient-level EHR data. The N3C is built for intensive ML analyses by academic, industry, and citizen scientists internationally. Many observational correlations can inform trial designs and care guidelines for this new disease.",The National COVID Cohort Collaborative: Clinical Characterization and Early Severity Prediction.,,,

These criteria are specified depending on corresponding clinical facts. Some of these facts may not be present in the clinical source systems and need to be calculated either in advance or at cohort query runtime (so-called feasibility query). OBJECTIVES: We use the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) as the repository for our clinical data. However, Atlas, the graphical user interface of OMOP, does not offer the functionality to perform calculations on facts data. Therefore, we were in search for a different approach. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the Arden Syntax can be used for feasibility queries on the OMOP CDM to enable on-the-fly calculations at query runtime, to eliminate the need to precalculate data elements that are involved with researchers' criteria specification. METHODS: We implemented a service that reads the facts from the OMOP repository and provides it in a form which an Arden Syntax Medical Logic Module (MLM) can process. Then, we implemented an MLM that applies the eligibility criteria to every patient data set and outputs the list of eligible cases (i.e., performs the feasibility query). RESULTS: The study resulted in an MLM-based feasibility query that identifies cases of overventilation as an example of how an on-the-fly calculation can be realized. The algorithm is split into two MLMs to provide the reusability of the approach. CONCLUSION: We found that MLMs are a suitable technology for feasibility queries on the OMOP CDM. Our method of performing on-the-fly calculations can be employed with any OMOP instance and without touching existing infrastructure like the Extract, Transform and Load pipeline. Therefore, we think that it is a well-suited method to perform on-the-fly calculations on OMOP.",Patient Cohort Identification on Time Series Data Using the OMOP Common Data Model.,"['*Algorithms', 'Cohort Studies', '*Databases, Factual']",,

The goal of this study was to improve the Korean EDI as a standard medical ontology in Korea. METHODS: We incorporated the EDI vocabulary into OMOP vocabulary through four main steps. First, we improved the current classification of EDI domains and separated medical services into procedures and measurements. Second, each EDI concept was assigned a unique identifier and validity dates. Third, we built a vertical hierarchy between EDI concepts, fully describing child concepts through relationships and attributes and linking them to parent terms. Finally, we added an English definition for each EDI concept. We translated the Korean definitions of EDI concepts using Google.Cloud.Translation.V3, using a client library and manual translation. We evaluated the EDI using 11 auditing criteria for controlled vocabularies. RESULTS: We incorporated 313,431 concepts from the EDI to the OMOP Standardized Vocabularies. For 10 of the 11 auditing criteria, EDI showed a better quality index within the OMOP vocabulary than in the original EDI vocabulary. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of the EDI vocabulary into the OMOP Standardized Vocabularies allows better standardization to facilitate network research.

The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate patients who require hospitalization from those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision-making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the ""prediction model risk of bias assessment"" criteria, and it has not been externally validated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to externally validate the C-19 index across a range of health care settings to determine how well it broadly predicts hospitalization due to pneumonia in COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We followed the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 index. We evaluated the model on two different target populations, 41,381 patients who presented with SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency department visit and 9,429,285 patients who presented with influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency department visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0-30 days. In total, we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. RESULTS: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index had a C statistic of 0.73, and the calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data, the model obtained C statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US, and South Korean data sets, respectively. The calibration was poor, with the model underestimating risk. When validated on 12 data sets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network, the C statistics ranged between 0.40 and 0.68. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 index model is low for influenza cohorts and even worse among patients with COVID-19 in the United States, Spain, and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.",Implementation of the COVID-19 Vulnerability Index Across an International Network of Health Care Data Sets: Collaborative External Validation Study.,,,

An efficient tool that can accurately recognize important clinical concepts of COVID-19 from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) will be valuable to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. To this end, this study aims at adapting the existing CLAMP natural language processing tool to quickly build COVID-19 SignSym, which can extract COVID-19 signs/symptoms and their 8 attributes (body location, severity, temporal expression, subject, condition, uncertainty, negation, and course) from clinical text. The extracted information is also mapped to standard concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. A hybrid approach of combining deep learning-based models, curated lexicons, and pattern-based rules was applied to quickly build the COVID-19 SignSym from CLAMP, with optimized performance. Our extensive evaluation using 3 external sites with clinical notes of COVID-19 patients, as well as the online medical dialogues of COVID-19, shows COVID-19 SignSym can achieve high performance across data sources. The workflow used for this study can be generalized to other use cases, where existing clinical natural language processing tools need to be customized for specific information needs within a short time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Advanced Cohort Engine (ACE) uses a temporal query language and in-memory datastore of patient objects to provide a fast, scalable, and expressive time-aware search. ACE accepts data in the Observational Medicine Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, and is configurable to balance performance with compute cost. ACE's temporal query language supports automatic query expansion using clinical knowledge graphs. The ACE API can be used with R, Python, Java, HTTP, and a Web UI. RESULTS: ACE offers an expressive query language for complex temporal search across many clinical data types with multiple output options. ACE enables electronic phenotyping and cohort-building with subsecond response times in searching the data of millions of patients for a variety of use cases. DISCUSSION: ACE enables fast, time-aware search using a patient object-centric datastore, thereby overcoming many technical and design shortcomings of relational algebra-based querying. Integrating electronic phenotype development with cohort-building enables a variety of high-value uses for a learning health system.

However, the complexity of chemotherapy regimens for cancer impedes retrospective research that uses observational health databases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the anticancer treatment trajectories and patterns of clinical events according to regimen type using the chemotherapy episodes determined by an algorithm. METHODS: We developed an algorithm to extract the regimen-level abstracted chemotherapy episodes from medication records in a conventional Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) database. The algorithm was validated on the Ajou University School Of Medicine (AUSOM) database by manual review of clinical notes. Using the algorithm, we extracted episodes of chemotherapy from patients in the EHR database and the claims database. We also developed an application software for visualizing the chemotherapy treatment patterns based on the treatment episodes in the OMOP-CDM database. Using this software, we generated the trends in the types of regimen used in the institutions, the patterns of the iterative chemotherapy use, and the trajectories of cancer treatment in two EHR-based OMOP-CDM databases. As a pilot study, the time of onset of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia according to regimen was measured using the AUSOM database. The anticancer treatment trajectories for patients with COVID-19 were also visualized based on the nationwide claims database. RESULTS: We generated 178,360 treatment episodes for patients with colorectal, breast, and lung cancer for 85 different regimens. The algorithm precisely identified the type of chemotherapy regimen in 400 patients (average positive predictive value >98%). The trends in the use of routine clinical chemotherapy regimens from 2008-2018 were identified for 8236 patients. For a total of 12 regimens (those administered to the largest proportion of patients), the number of repeated treatments was concordant with the protocols for standard chemotherapy regimens for certain cases. In addition, the anticancer treatment trajectories for 8315 patients were shown, including 62 patients with COVID-19. A comparative analysis of neutropenia showed that its onset in colorectal cancer regimens tended to cluster between days 9-15, whereas it tended to cluster between days 2-8 for certain regimens for breast cancer or lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a method for generating chemotherapy episodes for introduction into the oncology extension module of the OMOP-CDM databases. These proof-of-concept studies demonstrated the usability, scalability, and interoperability of the proposed framework through a distributed research network.",Characterizing the Anticancer Treatment Trajectory and Pattern in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer Using Harmonized Observational Databases: Retrospective Study.,,,

information on their prognosis is lacking. We characterized 30-day outcomes and mortality after hospitalization with COVID-19 among patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, and compared outcomes after hospital admissions among similar patients with seasonal influenza. METHODS: A multinational network cohort study was conducted using electronic health records data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center [USA, Optum (USA), Department of Veterans Affairs (USA), Information System for Research in Primary Care-Hospitalization Linked Data (Spain) and claims data from IQVIA Open Claims (USA) and Health Insurance and Review Assessment (South Korea). All patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, diagnosed and/or hospitalized between January and June 2020 with COVID-19, and similar patients hospitalized with influenza in 2017-18 were included. Outcomes were death and complications within 30 days of hospitalization. RESULTS: We studied 133 589 patients diagnosed and 48 418 hospitalized with COVID-19 with prevalent autoimmune diseases. Most patients were female, aged >/=50 years with previous comorbidities. The prevalence of hypertension (45.5-93.2%), chronic kidney disease (14.0-52.7%) and heart disease (29.0-83.8%) was higher in hospitalized vs diagnosed patients with COVID-19. Compared with 70 660 hospitalized with influenza, those admitted with COVID-19 had more respiratory complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and higher 30-day mortality (2.2-4.3% vs 6.32-24.6%).

While the use of the OHDSI has increased steadily over the past several years, review of the literature reveals few studies utilizing OHDSI in dermatology. To our knowledge, the University of Colorado School of Medicine is unique in its use of OHDSI for dermatology big data research. SUMMARY: A PubMed search was conducted in August 2020, followed by a literature review, with 24 of the 72 screened articles selected for inclusion. In this review, we discuss the ways OHDSI has been used to compile and analyze data, improve prediction and estimation capabilities, and inform treatment guidelines across specialties. We also discuss the potential for OHDSI in dermatology - specifically, ways that it could reveal adherence to available guidelines, establish standardized protocols, and ensure health equity. Key Messages: OHDSI has demonstrated broad utility in medicine. Adoption of OHDSI by the field of dermatology would facilitate big data research, allow for examination of current prescribing and treatment patterns without clear best practice guidelines, improve the dermatologic knowledge base and, by extension, improve patient outcomes.",Dermatologic Research Potential of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Network.,"['Big Data', 'Biomedical Research/*trends', '*Data Science', 'Dermatology/*trends', 'Humans', '*Medical Informatics']",,

To meet this need, several large clinical consortia have developed networks for access to RWD from electronic health records (EHR), each with its own common data model (CDM) and custom pipeline for extraction, transformation, and load operations for production and incremental updating. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely RWD (e.g., 2-week delay) make this less feasible. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical model for representation of clinical data for automated transformation to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs and the near automated production of linked clinical data repositories (CDRs) for COVID-19 research using the FHIR subscription standard. The approach was applied to healthcare data from a large academic institution and was evaluated using published quality assessment tools. RESULTS: Six years of data (1.07M patients, 10.1M encounters, 137M laboratory results), were loaded into the FHIR CDR producing 3 linked real-time linked repositories: FHIR, PCORnet, and OMOP. PCORnet and OMOP databases were refined in subsequent post processing steps into production releases and met published quality standards. The approach greatly reduced CDM production efforts. CONCLUSIONS: FHIR and FHIR CDRs can play an important role in enhancing the availability of RWD from EHR systems.

We extracted the PSG data of a university hospital for the period from 2004 to 2019. We designed and implemented an extract-transform-load (ETL) process to transform PSG data into the OMOP CDM format and verified the data quality through expert evaluation. We converted the data of 11,797 sleep studies into CDM and added 632,841 measurements and 9,535 observations to the existing CDM database. Among 86 PSG parameters, 20 were mapped to CDM standard vocabulary and 66 could not be mapped; thus, new custom standard concepts were created. We validated the conversion and usefulness of PSG data through patient-level prediction analyses for the CDM data. We believe that this study represents the first CDM conversion of PSG.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a framework for processing unstructured clinical documents of EHRs and integration with standardized structured data. METHODS: We developed a framework known as Staged Optimization of Curation, Regularization, and Annotation of clinical text (SOCRATex). SOCRATex has the following four aspects: (1) extracting clinical notes for the target population and preprocessing the data, (2) defining the annotation schema with a hierarchical structure, (3) performing document-level hierarchical annotation using the annotation schema, and (4) indexing annotations for a search engine system. To test the usability of the proposed framework, proof-of-concept studies were performed on EHRs. We defined three distinctive patient groups and extracted their clinical documents (ie, pathology reports, radiology reports, and admission notes). The documents were annotated and integrated into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-common data model (CDM) database. The annotations were used for creating Cox proportional hazard models with different settings of clinical analyses to measure (1) all-cause mortality, (2) thyroid cancer recurrence, and (3) 30-day hospital readmission. RESULTS: Overall, 1055 clinical documents of 953 patients were extracted and annotated using the defined annotation schemas. The generated annotations were indexed into an unstructured textual data repository. Using the annotations of pathology reports, we identified that node metastasis and lymphovascular tumor invasion were associated with all-cause mortality among colon and rectum cancer patients (both P=.02). The other analyses involving measuring thyroid cancer recurrence using radiology reports and 30-day hospital readmission using admission notes in depressive disorder patients also showed results consistent with previous findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a natural language processing (NLP) tool named Criteria2Query (Yuan et al., 2019) to transform free text clinical trial eligibility criteria from ClinicalTrials.gov into discrete criteria concepts and attributes encoded using the widely adopted Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and stored in a relational SQL database. A web application accessible via RESTful APIs was implemented to enable queries and visual aggregate analyses. We demonstrate CTKB's potential role in EHR phenotype knowledge engineering using ten validated phenotyping algorithms. RESULTS: At the time of writing, CTKB contained 87,504 distinctive OMOP CDM standard concepts, including Condition (47.82%), Drug (23.01%), Procedure (13.73%), Measurement (24.70%) and Observation (5.28%), with 34.78% for inclusion criteria and 65.22% for exclusion criteria, extracted from 352,110 clinical trials. The average hit rate of criteria concepts in eMERGE phenotype algorithms is 77.56%. CONCLUSION: CTKB is a novel comprehensive knowledge base of discrete eligibility criteria concepts with the potential to enable knowledge engineering for clinical trial cohort definition, clinical trial population representativeness assessment, electronical phenotyping, and data gap analyses for using electronic health records to support clinical trial recruitment.",A knowledge base of clinical trial eligibility criteria.,"['Algorithms', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Knowledge Bases', '*Natural Language Processing']",,

The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative seeks to improve research reproducibility through open science. METHODS: OHDSI has created an international federated data source of electronic health records and administrative claims that covers nearly 10% of the world's population. Using a common data model with a practical schema and extensive vocabulary mappings, data from around the world follow the identical format. OHDSI's research methods emphasize reproducibility, with a large-scale approach to addressing confounding using propensity score adjustment with extensive diagnostics; negative and positive control hypotheses to test for residual systematic error; a variety of data sources to assess consistency and generalizability; a completely open approach including protocol, software, models, parameters, and raw results so that studies can be externally verified; and the study of many hypotheses in parallel so that the operating characteristics of the methods can be assessed. RESULTS: OHDSI has already produced findings in areas like hypertension treatment that are being incorporated into practice, and it has produced rigorous studies of COVID-19 that have aided government agencies in their treatment decisions, that have characterized the disease extensively, that have estimated the comparative effects of treatments, and that the predict likelihood of advancing to serious complications. CONCLUSIONS: OHDSI practices open science and incorporates a series of methods to address reproducibility.

A hierarchical annotation schema based on the OMOP Common Data Model was developed to accommodate four levels of annotation granularity: i.e., study cohort, eligibility criteria, named entity and standard concept. In COVIC, 39 trials with more than one study cohorts were identified and labelled with an identifier for each cohort. 1,943 criteria for non-clinical characteristics such as ""informed consent"", ""exclusivity of participation"" were annotated. 9767 criteria were represented by 18,161 entities in 8 domains, 7,743 attributes of 7 attribute types and 16,443 relationships of 11 relationship types. 17,171 entities were mapped to standard medical concepts and 1,009 attributes were normalized into computable representations.

health sciences,"BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation but have been associated with complications in community-acquired pneumonia. Observations shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 suggested that ibuprofen was associated with an increased risk of adverse events in COVID-19 patients, but subsequent observational studies failed to demonstrate increased risk and in one case showed reduced risk associated with NSAID use. METHODS: A 38-center retrospective cohort study was performed that leveraged the harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. A propensity-matched cohort of COVID-19 inpatients was constructed by matching cases (treated with NSAIDs) and controls (not treated) from 857,061 patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome of interest was COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients, which was classified as: moderate, severe, or mortality/hospice. Secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), invasive ventilation, and all-cause mortality at any time following COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that NSAID use was not associated with increased COVID-19 severity (OR: 0.57 95% CI: 0.53-0.61). Analysis of secondary outcomes using logistic regression showed that NSAID use was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.51 95% CI: 0.47-0.56), invasive ventilation (OR: 0.59 95% CI: 0.55-0.64), AKI (OR: 0.67 95% CI: 0.63-0.72), or ECMO (OR: 0.51 95% CI: 0.36-0.7). In contrast, the odds ratios indicate reduced risk of these outcomes, but our quantitative bias analysis showed E-values of between 1.9 and 3.3 for these associations, indicating that comparatively weak or moderate confounder associations could explain away the observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Study interpretation is limited by the observational design. Recording of NSAID use may have been incomplete. Our study demonstrates that NSAID use is not associated with increased COVID-19 severity, all-cause mortality, invasive ventilation, AKI, or ECMO in COVID-19 inpatients. A conservative interpretation in light of the quantitative bias analysis is that there is no evidence that NSAID use is associated with risk of increased severity or the other measured outcomes. Our findings are the largest EHR-based analysis of the effect of NSAIDs on outcome in COVID-19 patients to date. Our results confirm and extend analogous findings in previous observational studies using a large cohort of patients drawn from 38 centers in a nationally representative multicenter database.",NSAID use and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients: A 38-center retrospective cohort study.,,,

Using electronic health records to find eligible patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria has been shown as a promising way to assess recruitment feasibility and accelerate the recruitment process. In this study, we analyzed the eligibility criteria of 100 randomly selected DS clinical trials and identified both computable and non-computable criteria. We mapped annotated entities to OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) with novel entities (e.g., DS).

We studied the granularity of concepts within 22 data sources in the OHDSI network and calculated a composite granularity score for each dataset. Three alternative SNOMED-based approaches for such score showed consistency in classifying data sources into three levels of granularity (low, moderate and high), which correlated with the provenance of data and country of origin.

DESIGN: Multinational network cohort study. SETTING: Hospital electronic health records from the United States, Spain, and China, and nationwide claims data from South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: 303 264 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 from January 2020 to December 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prescriptions or dispensations of any drug on or 30 days after the date of hospital admission for covid-19. RESULTS: Of the 303 264 patients included, 290 131 were from the US, 7599 from South Korea, 5230 from Spain, and 304 from China. 3455 drugs were identified. Common repurposed drugs were hydroxychloroquine (used in from <5 (<2%) patients in China to 2165 (85.1%) in Spain), azithromycin (from 15 (4.9%) in China to 1473 (57.9%) in Spain), combined lopinavir and ritonavir (from 156 (<2%) in the VA-OMOP US to 2,652 (34.9%) in South Korea and 1285 (50.5%) in Spain), and umifenovir (0% in the US, South Korea, and Spain and 238 (78.3%) in China). Use of adjunctive drugs varied greatly, with the five most used treatments being enoxaparin, fluoroquinolones, ceftriaxone, vitamin D, and corticosteroids. Hydroxychloroquine use increased rapidly from March to April 2020 but declined steeply in May to June and remained low for the rest of the year. The use of dexamethasone and corticosteroids increased steadily during 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple drugs were used in the first few months of the covid-19 pandemic, with substantial geographical and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most prescribed repurposed drugs. Antithrombotics, antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids were often used as adjunctive treatments.

Standardization schemes, such as the common data model, have been proposed as solutions to this problem, but such schemes require expensive human supervision. This study aims to construct a trainable system that can automate the process of semantic interinstitutional code mapping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To automate mapping between source and target codes, we compute the embedding-based semantic similarity between corresponding descriptive sentences. We also implement a systematic approach for preparing training data for similarity computation. Experimental results are compared to traditional word-based mappings. RESULTS: The proposed model is compared against the state-of-the-art automated matching system, which is called Usagi, of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. By incorporating multiple negative training samples per positive sample, our semantic matching method significantly outperforms Usagi. Its matching accuracy is at least 10% greater than that of Usagi, and this trend is consistent across various top-k measurements. DISCUSSION: The proposed deep learning-based mapping approach outperforms previous simple word-level matching algorithms because it can account for contextual and semantic information. Additionally, we demonstrate that the manner in which negative training samples are selected significantly affects the overall performance of the system. CONCLUSION: Incorporating the semantics of code descriptions more significantly increases matching accuracy compared to traditional text co-occurrence-based approaches. The negative training sample collection methodology is also an important component of the proposed trainable system that can be adopted in both present and future related systems.",Deep-learning-based automated terminology mapping in OMOP-CDM.,"['Algorithms', '*Deep Learning', 'Humans', 'Language', 'Semantics']",,

To meet this need, several large new data consortia have been developed that require frequent updating and sharing of electronic health record (EHR) data in different common data models (CDMs) to create multi-institutional databases for research. Traditionally, each CDM has had a custom pipeline for extract, transform, and load operations for production and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. However, the demands of COVID-19 research for timely data are far higher, and the requirements for updating faster than previous collaborative research using national data networks have increased. New approaches need to be developed to address these demands. METHODS: In this article, we describe the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical data model and the automated transformation of clinical data to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs for data sharing and research collaboration on COVID-19. RESULTS: FHIR data resources could be transformed to operational PCORnet and OMOP CDMs with minimal production delays through a combination of real-time and postprocessing steps, leveraging the FHIR data subscription feature. CONCLUSIONS: The approach leverages evolving standards for the availability of EHR data developed to facilitate data exchange under the 21st Century Cures Act and could greatly enhance the availability of standardized datasets for research.",Automated production of research data marts from a canonical fast healthcare interoperability resource data repository: applications to COVID-19 research.,"['Biomedical Research/*organization & administration', '*COVID-19', 'Common Data Elements', 'Data Management/organization & administration', '*Data Warehousing', '*Electronic Health Records', '*Health Information Interoperability', 'Humans', '*Information Dissemination']",,

For the active surveillance of drug safety, the use of real-world data and real-world evidence as part of the overall pharmacovigilance process is important. In this regard, many studies apply the data-driven approaches to support pharmacovigilance. We developed a pharmacovigilance data-processing pipeline (PDP) that utilized electronic health records (EHR) and spontaneous reporting system (SRS) data to explore pharmacovigilance signals. METHODS: To this end, we integrated two medical data sources: Konyang University Hospital (KYUH) EHR and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). As part of the presented PDP, we converted EHR data on the Observation Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. To evaluate the ability of using the proposed PDP for pharmacovigilance purposes, we performed a statistical validation using drugs that induce ear disorders. RESULTS: To validate the presented PDP, we extracted six drugs from the EHR that were significantly involved in ADRs causing ear disorders: nortriptyline, (hazard ratio [HR] 8.06, 95% CI 2.41-26.91); metoclopramide (HR 3.35, 95% CI 3.01-3.74); doxycycline (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.14-2.62); digoxin (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.08-2.38); acetaminophen (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.47-1.72); and sucralfate (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06-1.38). In FAERS, the strongest associations were found for nortriptyline (reporting odds ratio [ROR] 1.94, 95% CI 1.73-2.16), sucralfate (ROR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.45), doxycycline (ROR 1.30, 95% CI 1.20-1.40), and hydroxyzine (ROR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29). We confirmed the results in a meta-analysis using random and fixed models for doxycycline, hydroxyzine, metoclopramide, nortriptyline, and sucralfate. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed PDP could support active surveillance and the strengthening of potential ADR signals via real-world data sources.

Furthermore, to explore the possibility of maximizing analysis capabilities for our data set, we subsequently mapped the FHIR elements to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). The OMOP data model is designed to support the conduct of research to identify and evaluate associations between interventions and outcomes caused by these interventions. Mapping across standard allows to exploit their peculiarities while establishing and/or maintaining interoperability.

A distributed research network (DRN) is one of the challenges in privacy protection and in the encouragement of multi-institutional clinical research. A DRN standardizes multi-institutional data into a common structure and terminology called a common data model (CDM), and it only shares analysis results. It is necessary to measure how a DRN protects patient information privacy even without sharing data in practice. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the privacy risk of a DRN by comparing different deidentification levels focusing on personal health identifiers (PHIs) and quasi-identifiers (QIs). METHODS: We detected PHIs and QIs in an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM as threatening privacy, based on 18 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA) identifiers and previous studies. To compare the privacy risk according to the different privacy policies, we generated limited and safe harbor data sets based on 16 PHIs and 12 QIs as threatening privacy from the Synthetic Public Use File 5 Percent (SynPUF5PCT) data set, which is a public data set of the OMOP CDM. With minimum cell size and equivalence class methods, we measured the privacy risk reduction with a trust differential gap obtained by comparing the two data sets. We also measured the gap in randomly sampled records from the two data sets to adjust the number of PHI or QI records. RESULTS: The gaps averaged 31.448% and 73.798% for PHIs and QIs, respectively, with a minimum cell size of one, which represents a unique record in a data set. Among PHIs, the national provider identifier had the highest gap of 71.236% (71.244% and 0.007% in the limited and safe harbor data sets, respectively). The maximum size of the equivalence class, which has the largest size of an indistinguishable set of records, averaged 771. In 1000 random samples of PHIs, Device_exposure_start_date had the highest gap of 33.730% (87.705% and 53.975% in the data sets). Among QIs, Death had the highest gap of 99.212% (99.997% and 0.784% in the data sets). In 1000, 10,000, and 100,000 random samples of QIs, Device_treatment had the highest gaps of 12.980% (99.980% and 87.000% in the data sets), 60.118% (99.831% and 39.713%), and 93.597% (98.805% and 5.207%), respectively, and in 1 million random samples, Death had the highest gap of 99.063% (99.998% and 0.934% in the data sets). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we verified and quantified the privacy risk of PHIs and QIs in the DRN. Although this study used limited PHIs and QIs for verification, the privacy limitations found in this study could be used as a quality measurement index for deidentification of multi-institutional collaboration research, thereby increasing DRN safety.",Evaluation of the Privacy Risks of Personal Health Identifiers and Quasi-Identifiers in a Distributed Research Network: Development and Validation Study.,,,

We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Data Enclave, a harmonized electronic health record (EHR) dataset of 5.9 million nationally-representative, diverse, and gender-balanced patients, to describe outcomes in patients with CLD and cirrhosis with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We identified all chronic liver diseases patients with and without cirrhosis who had SARS-CoV-2 testing documented in the N3C Data Enclave as of data release date 5/15/2021. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Survival analysis methods were used to estimate cumulative incidences of death, hospitalization, and mechanical ventilation, and to calculate the associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, presence of cirrhosis, and demographic and clinical factors to 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We isolated 217,143 patients with CLD: 129,097 (59%) without cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 negative, 25,844 (12%) without cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 positive, 54,065 (25%) with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 negative, and 8,137 (4%) with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 positive. Among CLD patients without cirrhosis, 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 0.4% in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and 1.8% in positive patients. Among CLD patients with cirrhosis, 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 4.0% in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and 9.7% in positive patients.Compared to those who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was associated with more than two-fold (aHR 2.43, 95% CI 2.23-2.64) hazard of death at 30 days among patients with cirrhosis. Compared to patients without cirrhosis, the presence of cirrhosis was associated with a three-fold (aHR 3.39, 95% CI 2.96-3.89) hazard of death at 30 days among patients who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. Age (aHR 1.03 per year, 95% CI 1.03-1.04) was associated with death at 30 days among patients with cirrhosis who were SARS-CoV-2 positive. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of nearly 220,000 CLD patients, we found SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis was associated with 2.43-times mortality hazard, and the presence of cirrhosis among CLD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were associated with 3.39-times mortality hazard.

Properly learned medical concept embeddings (MCEs) capture the semantics of medical concepts, thus are useful for retrieving relevant medical features in phenotyping tasks. We compared the effectiveness of MCEs learned from knowledge graphs and electronic healthcare records (EHR) data in retrieving relevant medical features for phenotyping tasks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We implemented 5 embedding methods including node2vec, singular value decomposition (SVD), LINE, skip-gram, and GloVe with 2 data sources: (1) knowledge graphs obtained from the observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) common data model; and (2) patient-level data obtained from the OMOP compatible electronic health records (EHR) from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). We used phenotypes with their relevant concepts developed and validated by the electronic medical records and genomics (eMERGE) network to evaluate the performance of learned MCEs in retrieving phenotype-relevant concepts. Hits@k% in retrieving phenotype-relevant concepts based on a single and multiple seed concept(s) was used to evaluate MCEs. RESULTS: Among all MCEs, MCEs learned by using node2vec with knowledge graphs showed the best performance. Of MCEs based on knowledge graphs and EHR data, MCEs learned by using node2vec with knowledge graphs and MCEs learned by using GloVe with EHR data outperforms other MCEs, respectively. CONCLUSION: MCE enables scalable feature engineering tasks, thereby facilitating phenotyping. Based on current phenotyping practices, MCEs learned by using knowledge graphs constructed by hierarchical relationships among medical concepts outperformed MCEs learned by using EHR data.",Comparative effectiveness of medical concept embedding for feature engineering in phenotyping.,,,

To aid in this effort, we have developed an interpretable risk calculator that utilized de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of Alabama at Birmingham Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (UAB-i2b2) COVID-19 repository under the U-BRITE framework. The generated risk scores are analogous to commonly used credit scores where higher scores indicate higher risks for COVID-19 infection. By design, these risk scores can easily be calculated in spreadsheets or even with pen and paper. To predict risk, we implemented a Credit Scorecard modeling approach on longitudinal EHR data from 7,262 patients enrolled in the UAB Health System who were evaluated and/or tested for COVID-19 between January and June 2020. In this cohort, 912 patients were positive for COVID-19. Our workflow considered the timing of symptoms and medical conditions and tested the effects by applying different variable selection techniques such as LASSO and Elastic-Net. Within the two weeks before a COVID-19 diagnosis, the most predictive features were respiratory symptoms such as cough, abnormalities of breathing, pain in the throat and chest as well as other chronic conditions including nicotine dependence and major depressive disorder. When extending the timeframe to include all medical conditions across all time, our models also uncovered several chronic conditions impacting the respiratory, cardiovascular, central nervous and urinary organ systems. The whole pipeline of data processing, risk modeling and web-based risk calculator can be applied to any EHR data following the OMOP common data format.

Current trends in interoperability have moved from a data model technocentric approach to sustainable semantics, formal descriptive languages, and processes. Despite many initiatives and investments for decades, the interoperability challenge remains crucial. The need for data sharing for most purposes ranging from patient care to secondary uses, such as public health, research, and quality assessment, faces unmet problems. OBJECTIVE: This work was performed in the context of a large Swiss Federal initiative aiming at building a national infrastructure for reusing consented data acquired in the health care and research system to enable research in the field of personalized medicine in Switzerland. The initiative is the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN). This initiative is providing funding to foster use and exchange of health-related data for research. As part of the initiative, a national strategy to enable a semantically interoperable clinical data landscape was developed and implemented. METHODS: A deep analysis of various approaches to address interoperability was performed at the start, including large frameworks in health care, such as Health Level Seven (HL7) and Integrating Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), and in several domains, such as regulatory agencies (eg, Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium [CDISC]) and research communities (eg, Observational Medical Outcome Partnership [OMOP]), to identify bottlenecks and assess sustainability. Based on this research, a strategy composed of three pillars was designed. It has strong multidimensional semantics, descriptive formal language for exchanges, and as many data models as needed to comply with the needs of various communities. RESULTS: This strategy has been implemented stepwise in Switzerland since the middle of 2019 and has been adopted by all university hospitals and high research organizations. The initiative is coordinated by a central organization, the SPHN Data Coordination Center of the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The semantics is mapped by domain experts on various existing standards, such as Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), and International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The resource description framework (RDF) is used for storing and transporting data, and to integrate information from different sources and standards. Data transformers based on SPARQL query language are implemented to convert RDF representations to the numerous data models required by the research community or bridge with other systems, such as electronic case report forms. CONCLUSIONS: The SPHN strategy successfully implemented existing standards in a pragmatic and applicable way. It did not try to build any new standards but used existing ones in a nondogmatic way. It has now been funded for another 4 years, bringing the Swiss landscape into a new dimension to support research in the field of personalized medicine and large interoperable clinical data.","A National, Semantic-Driven, Three-Pillar Strategy to Enable Health Data Secondary Usage Interoperability for Research Within the Swiss Personalized Health Network: Methodological Study.",,,

EHR databases are currently being used in observational studies which lead to important findings in medical and biomedical sciences. However, the information present in clinical notes is not being used in those studies, since the computational analysis of this unstructured data is much complex in comparison to structured data. METHODS: We propose a two-stage workflow for solving an existing gap in Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL) procedures regarding observational databases. The first stage of the workflow extracts prescriptions present in patient's clinical notes, while the second stage harmonises the extracted information into their standard definition and stores the resulting information in a common database schema used in observational studies. RESULTS: We validated this methodology using two distinct data sets, in which the goal was to extract and store drug related information in a new Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) database. We analysed the performance of the used annotator as well as its limitations. Finally, we described some practical examples of how users can explore these datasets once migrated to OMOP CDM databases. CONCLUSION: With this methodology, we were able to show a strategy for using the information extracted from the clinical notes in business intelligence tools, or for other applications such as data exploration through the use of SQL queries. Besides, the extracted information complements the data present in OMOP CDM databases which was not directly available in the EHR database.",A two-stage workflow to extract and harmonize drug mentions from clinical notes into observational databases.,"['Databases, Factual', 'Delivery of Health Care', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Workflow']",,

(N3C) is a centralized, harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record repository that is the largest, most representative COVID-19 cohort to date. This multicenter data set can support robust evidence-based development of predictive and diagnostic tools and inform clinical care and policy. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate COVID-19 severity and risk factors over time and assess the use of machine learning to predict clinical severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a retrospective cohort study of 1 926 526 US adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction >99% or antigen <1%) and adult patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection who served as controls from 34 medical centers nationwide between January 1, 2020, and December 7, 2020, patients were stratified using a World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and demographic characteristics. Differences between groups over time were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Random forest and XGBoost models were used to predict severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilatory support, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient demographic characteristics and COVID-19 severity using the World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohort included 174 568 adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 44.4 [18.6] years; 53.2% female) and 1 133 848 adult controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [19.2] years; 57.1% female). Of the 174 568 adults with SARS-CoV-2, 32 472 (18.6%) were hospitalized, and 6565 (20.2%) of those had a severe clinical course (invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, death, or discharge to hospice). Of the hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6% overall and decreased from 16.4% in March to April 2020 to 8.6% in September to October 2020 (P = .002 for monthly trend). Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, this study predicted a severe clinical course using random forest and XGBoost models (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.87 for both) that were stable over time. The factor most strongly associated with clinical severity was pH; this result was consistent across machine learning methods. In a separate multivariable logistic regression model built for inference, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04), male sex (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.51-1.69), liver disease (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.34), dementia (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.13-1.41), African American (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.20) and Asian (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12-1.57) race, and obesity (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.27-1.46) were independently associated with higher clinical severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that COVID-19 mortality decreased over time during 2020 and that patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were associated with higher clinical severity. The machine learning models accurately predicted ultimate clinical severity using commonly collected clinical data from the first 24 hours of a hospital admission.",Clinical Characterization and Prediction of Clinical Severity of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among US Adults Using Data From the US National COVID Cohort Collaborative.,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*COVID-19/ethnology/mortality', 'Comorbidity', '*Databases, Factual', 'Ethnicity', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', 'Female', '*Forecasting', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Pandemics', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",,

METHODS: We conducted a cohort study based on outpatient/inpatient care and claims data from January to June 2020 from Spain, the UK, and the US. We used six databases standardized to the OMOP common data model. We defined two non-mutually exclusive cohorts of patients diagnosed and/or hospitalized with COVID-19; patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We report the frequency of demographics, prior medical conditions, and 30-days outcomes (hospitalization, events, and death) by obesity status. RESULTS: We included 627 044 (Spain: 122 058, UK: 2336, and US: 502 650) diagnosed and 160 013 (Spain: 18 197, US: 141 816) hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The prevalence of obesity was higher among patients hospitalized (39.9%, 95%CI: 39.8-40.0) than among those diagnosed with COVID-19 (33.1%; 95%CI: 33.0-33.2). In both cohorts, PLWO were more often female. Hospitalized PLWO were younger than patients without obesity. Overall, COVID-19 PLWO were more likely to have prior medical conditions, present with cardiovascular and respiratory events during hospitalization, or require intensive services compared to COVID-19 patients without obesity. CONCLUSION: We show that PLWO differ from patients without obesity in a wide range of medical conditions and present with more severe forms of COVID-19, with higher hospitalization rates and intensive services requirements. These findings can help guiding preventive strategies of COVID-19 infection and complications and generating hypotheses for causal inference studies.","Characteristics and outcomes of 627 044 COVID-19 patients living with and without obesity in the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom.","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'COVID-19/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,

Second, we compared patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients hospitalized with influenza. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using eight routinely collected health care databases from Spain and the United States, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model. Three cohorts of patients with a history of cancer were included: (i) diagnosed with COVID-19, (ii) hospitalized with COVID-19, and (iii) hospitalized with influenza in 2017 to 2018. Patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We reported demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes. RESULTS: We included 366,050 and 119,597 patients diagnosed and hospitalized with COVID-19, respectively. Prostate and breast cancers were the most frequent cancers (range: 5%-18% and 1%-14% in the diagnosed cohort, respectively). Hematologic malignancies were also frequent, with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma being among the five most common cancer subtypes in the diagnosed cohort. Overall, patients were aged above 65 years and had multiple comorbidities. Occurrence of death ranged from 2% to 14% and from 6% to 26% in the diagnosed and hospitalized COVID-19 cohorts, respectively. Patients hospitalized with influenza (n = 67,743) had a similar distribution of cancer subtypes, sex, age, and comorbidities but lower occurrence of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of cancer and COVID-19 had multiple comorbidities and a high occurrence of COVID-19-related events. Hematologic malignancies were frequent.

We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a harmonized electronic health record dataset of 6.4 million, to describe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes in patients with CLD and cirrhosis. METHODS: We identified all patients with CLD with or without cirrhosis who had SARS-CoV-2 testing in the N3C Data Enclave as of July 1, 2021. We used survival analyses to associate SARS-CoV-2 infection, presence of cirrhosis, and clinical factors with the primary outcome of 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We isolated 220,727 patients with CLD and SARS-CoV-2 test status: 128,864 (58%) were noncirrhosis/negative, 29,446 (13%) were noncirrhosis/positive, 53,476 (24%) were cirrhosis/negative, and 8941 (4%) were cirrhosis/positive patients. Thirty-day all-cause mortality rates were 3.9% in cirrhosis/negative and 8.9% in cirrhosis/positive patients. Compared to cirrhosis/negative patients, cirrhosis/positive patients had 2.38 times adjusted hazard of death at 30 days. Compared to noncirrhosis/positive patients, cirrhosis/positive patients had 3.31 times adjusted hazard of death at 30 days. In stratified analyses among patients with cirrhosis with increased age, obesity, and comorbid conditions (ie, diabetes, heart failure, and pulmonary disease), SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased adjusted hazard of death. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of approximately 221,000 nationally representative, diverse, and sex-balanced patients with CLD; we found SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis was associated with 2.38 times mortality hazard, and the presence of cirrhosis among patients with CLD infected with SARS-CoV-2 was associated with 3.31 times mortality hazard.

Feasibility platforms are often the first contact point for determining the availability of such data for specific research questions. Therefore, a user-friendly interface should be provided to enable access to this information easily. The German Medical Informatics Initiative also aims to establish such a platform for its infrastructure. Although some of these platforms are actively used, their tools still have limitations. Consequently, the Medical Informatics Initiative consortium MIRACUM (Medical Informatics in Research and Care in University Medicine) committed itself to analyzing the pros and cons of existing solutions and to designing an optimized graphical feasibility user interface. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the system that is most user-friendly and thus forms the best basis for developing a harmonized tool. To achieve this goal, we carried out a comparative usability evaluation of existing tools used by researchers acting as end users. METHODS: The evaluation included three preselected search tools and was conducted as a qualitative exploratory study with a randomized design over a period of 6 weeks. The tools in question were the MIRACUM i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) feasibility platform, OHDSI's (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) ATLAS, and the Sample Locator of the German Biobank Alliance. The evaluation was conducted in the form of a web-based usability test (usability walkthrough combined with a web-based questionnaire) with participants aged between 26 and 63 years who work as medical doctors. RESULTS: In total, 17 study participants evaluated the three tools. The overall evaluation of usability, which was based on the System Usability Scale, showed that the Sample Locator, with a mean System Usability Scale score of 77.03 (SD 20.62), was significantly superior to the other two tools (Wilcoxon test; Sample Locator vs i2b2: P=.047; Sample Locator vs ATLAS: P=.001). i2b2, with a score of 59.83 (SD 25.36), performed significantly better than ATLAS, which had a score of 27.81 (SD 21.79; Wilcoxon test; i2b2 vs ATLAS: P=.005). The analysis of the material generated by the usability walkthrough method confirmed these findings. ATLAS caused the most usability problems (n=66), followed by i2b2 (n=48) and the Sample Locator (n=22). Moreover, the Sample Locator achieved the highest ratings with respect to additional questions regarding satisfaction with the tools. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data to develop a suitable basis for the selection of a harmonized tool for feasibility studies via concrete evaluation and a comparison of the usability of three different types of query builders.

Standardizations in data structure, such as use of common data models, need to be coupled with standardized approaches for data quality assessment. To ensure confidence in real-world evidence generated from the analysis of real-world data, one must first have confidence in the data itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe the implementation of check types across a data quality framework of conformance, completeness, plausibility, with both verification and validation. We illustrate how data quality checks, paired with decision thresholds, can be configured to customize data quality reporting across a range of observational health data sources. We discuss how data quality reporting can become part of the overall real-world evidence generation and dissemination process to promote transparency and build confidence in the resulting output. RESULTS: The Data Quality Dashboard is an open-source R package that reports potential quality issues in an OMOP CDM instance through the systematic execution and summarization of over 3300 configurable data quality checks. DISCUSSION: Transparently communicating how well common data model-standardized databases adhere to a set of quality measures adds a crucial piece that is currently missing from observational research.

Tackling chronic diseases such as DM requires innovative strategies to integrate patients' data from diverse sources and use scientific discovery to inform clinical practice that can help better manage the disease. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) was chosen as the framework for integrating data with disparate formats. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of converting Singapore based data source, comprising of electronic health records (EHR), cognitive and depression assessment questionnaire data to OMOP CDM standard. Additionally, we also validate whether our OMOP CDM instance is fit for the purpose of research by executing a simple treatment pathways study using Atlas, a graphical user interface tool to conduct analysis on OMOP CDM data as a proof of concept. METHODS: We used de-identified EHR, cognitive, and depression assessment questionnaires data from a tertiary care hospital in Singapore to convert it to version 5.3.1 of OMOP CDM standard. We evaluate the OMOP CDM conversion by (1) assessing the mapping coverage (that is the percentage of source terms mapped to OMOP CDM standard); (2) local raw dataset versus CDM dataset analysis; and (3) Implementing Harmonized Intrinsic Data Quality Framework using an open-source R package called Data Quality Dashboard. RESULTS: The content coverage of OMOP CDM vocabularies is more than 90% for clinical data, but only around 11% for questionnaire data.

Using a longer lookback for feature engineering gives more insight about patients but increases the issue of left-censoring. METHODS: We used five US observational databases to develop patient-level prediction models. A target cohort of subjects with hypertensive drug exposures and outcome cohorts of subjects with acute (stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding) and chronic outcomes (diabetes and chronic kidney disease) were developed. Candidate predictors that exist on or prior to the target index date were derived within the following lookback periods: 14, 30, 90, 180, 365, 730, and all days prior to index were evaluated. We predicted the risk of outcomes occurring 1 day until 365 days after index. Ten lasso logistic models for each lookback period were generated to create a distribution of area under the curve (AUC) metrics to evaluate the discriminative performance of the models. Calibration intercept and slope were also calculated. Impact on external validation performance was investigated across five databases. RESULTS: The maximum differences in AUCs for the models developed using different lookback periods within a database was < 0.04 for diabetes (in MDCR AUC of 0.593 with 14-day lookback vs. AUC of 0.631 with all-time lookback) and 0.012 for renal impairment (in MDCR AUC of 0.675 with 30-day lookback vs. AUC of 0.687 with 365-day lookback ). For the acute outcomes, the max difference in AUC across lookbacks within a database was 0.015 (in MDCD AUC of 0.767 with 14-day lookback vs. AUC 0.782 with 365-day lookback) for stroke and < 0.03 for gastrointestinal bleeding (in CCAE AUC of 0.631 with 14-day lookback vs. AUC of 0.660 with 730-day lookback). CONCLUSIONS: In general the choice of covariate lookback had only a small impact on discrimination and calibration, with a short lookback (< 180 days) occasionally decreasing discrimination. Based on the results, if training a logistic regression model for prediction then using covariates with a 365 day lookback appear to be a good tradeoff between performance and interpretation.",Evaluating the impact of covariate lookback times on performance of patient-level prediction models.,"['Area Under Curve', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', '*Stroke', 'Time']",,

The electronic health records (EHRs) data are useful for estimating the population representativeness of clinical trial study population.

METHODS: We present an end-to-end analytical framework for transforming free-text clinical trial eligibility criteria into executable database queries conformant with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model and for systematically quantifying the population representativeness for each clinical trial. RESULTS: We calculated the population representativeness of 782 novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trials and 3,827 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) trials in the United States respectively using this framework. With the use of overly restrictive eligibility criteria, 85.7% of the COVID-19 trials and 30.1% of T2DM trials had poor population representativeness.

We compared the original and CDM HF patient population by calculating and presenting descriptive statistics of demographics, related comorbidities, and relevant clinical biomarkers. RESULTS: We identified a cohort of 502 536 patients with the incident and prevalent HF and converted 1 099 195 384 rows of data from 216 581 914 encounters across three EHR sources to the OMOP CDM.

The raw and transformed data were similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities with the largest difference observed being 3.78% in the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can successfully be applied to convert EHR linked across multiple healthcare settings and represent phenotyping algorithms spanning multiple sources.

Understanding drug prescription patterns of type 2 diabetes mellitus may facilitate diabetes management. We aimed to analyze treatment patterns of type 2 diabetes mellitus using Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model based on electronic health records. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study employed electronic health records of patients who visited Jeonbuk National University Hospital in Korea during January 2000-December 2019. Data were transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model and analyzed using R version 4.0.3 and ATLAS ver. 2.7.6. Prescription frequency for each anti-diabetic drug, combination therapy pattern, and prescription pattern according to age, renal function, and glycated hemoglobin were analyzed. RESULTS: The number of adults treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus increased from 1,867 (2.0%) in 2000 to 9,972 (5.9%) in 2019. In the early 2000s, sulfonylurea was most commonly prescribed (73%), and in the recent years, metformin has been most commonly prescribed (64%). Prescription rates for DPP4 and SGLT2 inhibitors have increased gradually over the past few years. Monotherapy prescription rates decreased, whereas triple and quadruple combination prescription rates increased steadily. Different drug prescription patterns according to age, renal function, and glycated hemoglobin were observed. The proportion of patients with HbA1c </= 7% increased from 31.1% in 2000 to 45.6% in 2019, but that of patients visiting the emergency room for severe hypoglycemia did not change over time. CONCLUSION: Medication utilization patterns have changed significantly over the past 20 years with an increase in the use of newer drugs and a shift to combination therapies. In addition, various prescription patterns were demonstrated according to the patient characteristics in actual practice.

For this, we calculated the mapping score for different data categories and the relative data coverage in both FHIR and OMOP CDM. Our results show, that the patients genomic data can be mapped to OMOP CDM directly from VCF (Variant Call Format) file with a coverage of slightly over 50%. However, using FHIR as intermediate representation does not lead to further information loss as the already stored data in FHIR can be further transformed into OMOP CDM format with almost 100% success.

However, none of these COVID-19 prediction models have been found to be reliable. Models are commonly assessed to have a risk of bias, often due to insufficient reporting, use of non-representative data, and lack of large-scale external validation. In this paper, we present the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) analytics pipeline for patient-level prediction modeling as a standardized approach for rapid yet reliable development and validation of prediction models. We demonstrate how our analytics pipeline and open-source software tools can be used to answer important prediction questions while limiting potential causes of bias (e.g., by validating phenotypes, specifying the target population, performing large-scale external validation, and publicly providing all analytical source code). METHODS: We show step-by-step how to implement the analytics pipeline for the question: 'In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, what is the risk of death 0 to 30 days after hospitalization?'. We develop models using six different machine learning methods in a USA claims database containing over 20,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations and externally validate the models using data containing over 45,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations from South Korea, Spain, and the USA. RESULTS: Our open-source software tools enabled us to efficiently go end-to-end from problem design to reliable Model Development and evaluation. When predicting death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, AdaBoost, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and decision tree yielded similar or lower internal and external validation discrimination performance compared to L1-regularized logistic regression, whereas the MLP neural network consistently resulted in lower discrimination. L1-regularized logistic regression models were well calibrated.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate prediction models for all-cause unplanned hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge, based on a common data model (CDM), which can be applied to multiple institutions for efficient readmission management. METHODS: Retrospective patient-level prediction models were developed based on clinical data of two tertiary general university hospitals converted into a CDM developed by Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership. Machine learning classification models based on the LASSO logistic regression model, decision tree, AdaBoost, random forest, and gradient boosting machine (GBM) were developed and tested by manipulating a set of CDM variables. An internal 10-fold cross-validation was performed on the target data of the model. To examine its transportability, the model was externally validated. Verification indicators helped evaluate the model performance based on the values of area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: Based on the time interval for outcome prediction, it was confirmed that the prediction model targeting the variables obtained within 30 days of discharge was the most efficient (AUC of 82.75). The external validation showed that the model is transferable, with the combination of various clinical covariates. Above all, the prediction model based on the GBM showed the highest AUC performance of 84.14 +/- 0.015 for the Seoul National University Hospital cohort, yielding in 78.33 in external validation. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that readmission prediction models developed using machine-learning techniques and CDM can be a useful tool to compare two hospitals in terms of patient-data features.",Development of Prediction Models for Unplanned Hospital Readmission within 30 Days Based on Common Data Model: A Feasibility Study.,"['Area Under Curve', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', '*Patient Readmission', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies']",,

informatics community united to aggregate as much clinical data as possible to characterize this new disease and reduce its impact through collaborative analytics. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is now the largest publicly available HIPAA limited dataset in US history with over 6.4 million patients and is a testament to a partnership of over 100 organizations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a pipeline for ingesting, harmonizing, and centralizing data from 56 contributing data partners using 4 federated Common Data Models. N3C data quality (DQ) review involves both automated and manual procedures. In the process, several DQ heuristics were discovered in our centralized context, both within the pipeline and during downstream project-based analysis. Feedback to the sites led to many local and centralized DQ improvements. RESULTS: Beyond well-recognized DQ findings, we discovered 15 heuristics relating to source Common Data Model conformance, demographics, COVID tests, conditions, encounters, measurements, observations, coding completeness, and fitness for use. Of 56 sites, 37 sites (66%) demonstrated issues through these heuristics. These 37 sites demonstrated improvement after receiving feedback. DISCUSSION: We encountered site-to-site differences in DQ which would have been challenging to discover using federated checks alone. We have demonstrated that centralized DQ benchmarking reveals unique opportunities for DQ improvement that will support improved research analytics locally and in aggregate. CONCLUSION: By combining rapid, continual assessment of DQ with a large volume of multisite data, it is possible to support more nuanced scientific questions with the scale and rigor that they require.",Synergies between centralized and federated approaches to data quality: a report from the national COVID cohort collaborative.,"['*COVID-19', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data Accuracy', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Humans', 'United States']",,

Its incidence varies among surgeons and institutions, making it difficult to determine its actual incidence and associated factors. This study attempted to estimate the incidence of post-operative hypoparathyroidism in patients at two tertiary institutions that share a common data model, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics. This study used the Common Data Model to extract explicitly specified encoding and relationships among concepts using standardized vocabularies. The EDI-codes of various thyroid disorders and thyroid operations were extracted from two separate tertiary hospitals between January 2013 and December 2018. Patients were grouped into no evidence of/transient/permanent hypoparathyroidism groups to analyze the likelihood of hypoparathyroidism occurrence related to operation types and diagnosis. Of the 4848 eligible patients at the two institutions who underwent thyroidectomy, 1370 (28.26%) experienced transient hypoparathyroidism and 251 (5.18%) experienced persistent hypoparathyroidism. Univariate logistic regression analysis predicted that, relative to total bilateral thyroidectomy, radical tumor resection was associated with a 48% greater likelihood of transient hypoparathyroidism and a 102% greater likelihood of persistent hypoparathyroidism. Moreover, multivariate logistic analysis found that radical tumor resection was associated with a 50% greater likelihood of transient hypoparathyroidism and a 97% greater likelihood of persistent hypoparathyroidism than total bilateral thyroidectomy. These findings, by integrating and analyzing two databases, suggest that this analysis could be expanded to include other large databases that share the same Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics protocol.",Assessment of Inter-Institutional Post-Operative Hypoparathyroidism Status Using a Common Data Model.,,,

The ASH Research Collaborative houses 2 major initiatives: (1) the Data Hub and (2) the Clinical Trials Network (CTN). The Data Hub is a program for hematologic diseases in which networks of clinical care delivery sites are developed in specific disease areas, with individual patient data contributed through electronic health record (EHR) integration, direct data entry through electronic data capture, and external data sources. Disease-specific data models are constructed so that data can be assembled into analytic datasets and used to enhance clinical care through dashboards and other mechanisms. Initial models have been built in multiple myeloma (MM) and sickle cell disease (SCD) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards. The Data Hub also provides a framework for development of disease-specific learning communities (LC) and testing of health care delivery strategies. The ASH Research Collaborative SCD CTN is a clinical trials accelerator that creates efficiencies in the execution of multicenter clinical trials and has been initially developed for SCD. Both components are operational, with the Data Hub actively aggregating source data and the SCD CTN reviewing study candidates.

The sharing of these data and tools is generally affected by the lack of system interoperability. To overcome these issues, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) developed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) to standardize EHR data and promote large-scale observational and longitudinal research. Anesthesia data have not previously been mapped into the OMOP CDM. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to transform anesthesia data into the OMOP CDM. The secondary objective was to provide vocabularies, queries, and dashboards that might promote the exploitation and sharing of anesthesia data through the CDM. METHODS: Using our local anesthesia data warehouse, a group of 5 experts from 5 different medical centers identified local concepts related to anesthesia. The concepts were then matched with standard concepts in the OHDSI vocabularies. We performed structural mapping between the design of our local anesthesia data warehouse and the OMOP CDM tables and fields. To validate the implementation of anesthesia data into the OMOP CDM, we developed a set of queries and dashboards. RESULTS: We identified 522 concepts related to anesthesia care. They were classified as demographics, units, measurements, operating room steps, drugs, periods of interest, and features. After semantic mapping, 353 (67.7%) of these anesthesia concepts were mapped to OHDSI concepts. Further, 169 (32.3%) concepts related to periods and features were added to the OHDSI vocabularies. Then, 8 OMOP CDM tables were implemented with anesthesia data and 2 new tables (EPISODE and FEATURE) were added to store secondarily computed data. We integrated data from 5,72,609 operations and provided the code for a set of 8 queries and 4 dashboards related to anesthesia care. CONCLUSIONS: Generic data concerning demographics, drugs, units, measurements, and operating room steps were already available in OHDSI vocabularies. However, most of the intraoperative concepts (the duration of specific steps, an episode of hypotension, etc) were not present in OHDSI vocabularies.

CDM transformation allows for analysis across disparate databases for the generation of new, real-word evidence, which is especially important in rare disease where data are limited. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive, life-threatening disease, with rare subgroups such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), for which generating real-world evidence is challenging. Our objective is to document the process and outcomes of transforming registry data in PH to the OMOP CDM, and highlight challenges and our potential solutions. METHODS: Three observational studies were transformed from the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium study data tabulation model (SDTM) to OMOP CDM format. OPUS was a prospective, multi-centre registry (2014-2020) and OrPHeUS was a retrospective, multi-centre chart review (2013-2017); both enrolled patients newly treated with macitentan in the US. EXPOSURE is a prospective, multi-centre cohort study (2017-ongoing) of patients newly treated with selexipag or any PAH-specific therapy in Europe and Canada. OMOP CDM version 5.3.1 with recent OMOP CDM vocabulary was used. Imputation rules were defined and applied for missing dates to avoid exclusion of data. Custom target concepts were introduced when existing concepts did not provide sufficient granularity. RESULTS: Of the 6622 patients in the three registry studies, records were mapped for 6457. Custom target concepts were introduced for PAH subgroups (by combining SNOMED concepts or creating custom concepts) and World Health Organization functional class. Per the OMOP CDM convention, records about the absence of an event, or the lack of information, were not mapped. Excluding these non-event records, 4% (OPUS), 2% (OrPHeUS) and 1% (EXPOSURE) of records were not mapped. CONCLUSIONS: SDTM data from three registries were transformed to the OMOP CDM with limited exclusion of data and deviation from the SDTM database content.

METHODS: Patients with endophthalmitis that developed within 6 weeks after intravitreal anti-VEGF injections were identified in 3 large OMOP CDM databases. RESULTS: We identified 23,490 patients who received 128,123 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. The incidence rates of endophthalmitis were 15.75 per 10,000 patients and 2.97 per 10,000 injections. The incidence rates of endophthalmitis for bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept (per 10,000 injections) were 3.64, 1.39, and 0.76, respectively. The annual incidence has remained below 5.00 per 10,000 injections since 2011 despite the increasing number of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections. Bevacizumab presented a higher incidence rate for endophthalmitis than ranibizumab and aflibercept (incidence rate ratio, 3.17; p=0.021). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of endophthalmitis after intravitreal anti-VEGF injections has stabilized since 2011 despite the explosive increase in anti-VEGF injections. The off-label use of bevacizumab accounted for its disproportionately high incidence of endophthalmitis. The OMOP CDM, which includes off-label uses, laboratory data, and a scalable standardized database, could provide a novel strategy to reveal real-world evidence, especially in ophthalmology.",Real-world incidence of endopthalmitis after intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in Korea: findings from the Common Data Model in ophthalmology.,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Ophthalmology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A']",,

In order to fully assess the situation, data from multiple systems (electronic medical records, pharmacy and radiology information systems, laboratory management systems, etc.) from multiple organizations (outpatient clinics, hospitals, long-term care facilities, laboratories, pharmacies, registries, governments) on a large geographical scale is needed.

In such settings, privacy concerns typically prohibit sharing of individual patient data, and instead, cross-network analyses can only utilize summary statistics from the individual databases such as hazard ratios and standard errors. In the specific but very common context of the Cox proportional hazards model, we show that combining such per site summary statistics into a single network-wide estimate using standard meta-analysis methods leads to substantial bias when outcome counts are small. This bias derives primarily from the normal approximations of the per site likelihood that the methods utilized. Here we propose and evaluate methods that eschew normal approximations in favor of three more flexible approximations: a skew-normal, a one-dimensional grid, and a custom parametric function that mimics the behavior of the Cox likelihood function. In extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate how these approximations impact bias in the context of both fixed-effects and (Bayesian) random-effects models. We then apply these approaches to three real-world studies of the comparative safety of antidepressants, each using data from four observational health care databases.",Combining cox regressions across a heterogeneous distributed research network facing small and zero counts.,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Bias', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",,

As the ITCR ecosystem substantially grows, it faces the challenge of the long-term sustainability of the software being developed by ITCR grantees. To address this challenge, the ITCR sustainability and industry partnership working group (SIP-WG) was convened in 2019. OBJECTIVE: The charter of the SIP-WG is to investigate options to enhance the long-term sustainability of the OSS being developed by ITCR, in part by developing a collection of business model archetypes that can serve as sustainability plans for ITCR OSS development initiatives. The working group assembled models from the ITCR program, from other studies, and from the engagement of its extensive network of relationships with other organizations (eg, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Open Source Initiative, and Software Sustainability Institute) in support of this objective. METHODS: This paper reviews the existing sustainability models and describes 10 OSS use cases disseminated by the SIP-WG and others, including 3D Slicer, Bioconductor, Cytoscape, Globus, i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) and tranSMART, Insight Toolkit, Linux, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics tools, R, and REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), in 10 sustainability aspects: governance, documentation, code quality, support, ecosystem collaboration, security, legal, finance, marketing, and dependency hygiene. RESULTS: Information available to the public reveals that all 10 OSS have effective governance, comprehensive documentation, high code quality, reliable dependency hygiene, strong user and developer support, and active marketing. These OSS include a variety of licensing models (eg, general public license version 2, general public license version 3, Berkeley Software Distribution, and Apache 3) and financial models (eg, federal research funding, industry and membership support, and commercial support). However, detailed information on ecosystem collaboration and security is not publicly provided by most OSS. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend 6 essential attributes for research software: alignment with unmet scientific needs, a dedicated development team, a vibrant user community, a feasible licensing model, a sustainable financial model, and effective product management. We also stress important actions to be considered in future ITCR activities that involve the discussion of the sustainability and licensing models for ITCR OSS, the establishment of a central library, the allocation of consulting resources to code quality control, ecosystem collaboration, security, and dependency hygiene.",Open-source Software Sustainability Models: Initial White Paper From the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research Sustainability and Industry Partnership Working Group.,"['*Ecosystem', 'Humans', 'Informatics', '*Neoplasms/therapy', 'Research', 'Software', 'Technology']",,

TKR is a safe and cost-effective surgical procedure for treating severe knee osteoarthritis (OA). Although complications following surgery are rare, prediction tools could help identify high-risk patients who could be targeted with preventative interventions. The aim was to develop and validate a simple model to help inform treatment choices. METHODS: A mortality prediction model for knee OA patients following TKR was developed and externally validated using a US claims database and a UK general practice database. The target population consisted of patients undergoing a primary TKR for knee OA, aged >/= 40 years and registered for >/= 1 year before surgery. LASSO logistic regression models were developed for post-operative (90-day) mortality. A second mortality model was developed with a reduced feature set to increase interpretability and usability. RESULTS: A total of 193,615 patients were included, with 40,950 in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database and 152,665 in Optum. The full model predicting 90-day mortality yielded AUROC of 0.78 when trained in OPTUM and 0.70 when externally validated on THIN. The 12 variable model achieved internal AUROC of 0.77 and external AUROC of 0.71 in THIN. CONCLUSIONS: A simple prediction model based on sex, age, and 10 comorbidities that can identify patients at high risk of short-term mortality following TKR was developed that demonstrated good, robust performance. The 12-feature mortality model is easily implemented and the performance suggests it could be used to inform evidence based shared decision-making prior to surgery and targeting prophylaxis for those at high risk.

The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) is the first open access database in the ICU domain. Many studies have shown that common data models (CDMs) improve database searching by allowing code, tools, and experience to be shared. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM is spreading all over the world. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to transform MIMIC into an OMOP database and to evaluate the benefits of this transformation for analysts. METHODS: We transformed MIMIC (version 1.4.21) into OMOP format (version 5.3.3.1) through semantic and structural mapping. The structural mapping aimed at moving the MIMIC data into the right place in OMOP, with some data transformations. The mapping was divided into 3 phases: conception, implementation, and evaluation. The conceptual mapping aimed at aligning the MIMIC local terminologies to OMOP's standard ones. It consisted of 3 phases: integration, alignment, and evaluation. A documented, tested, versioned, exemplified, and open repository was set up to support the transformation and improvement of the MIMIC community's source code. The resulting data set was evaluated over a 48-hour datathon. RESULTS: With an investment of 2 people for 500 hours, 64% of the data items of the 26 MIMIC tables were standardized into the OMOP CDM and 78% of the source concepts mapped to reference terminologies. The model proved its ability to support community contributions and was well received during the datathon, with 160 participants and 15,000 requests executed with a maximum duration of 1 minute.

In Korea, national insurance electronic data interchange (EDI) code has been used as a medical device data source for common data model (CDM). This study performed a preliminary feasibility assessment of CDM-based vigilance. A cross-sectional study of target medical device data in EHR and CDM was conducted. A total of 155 medical devices were finally enrolled, with 58.7% of them having EDI codes. Femoral head prosthesis was selected as a focus group. It was registered in our institute with 11 EDI codes. However, only three EDI codes were converted to systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terms concept. EDI code was matched in one-to-many (up to 104) with unique device identifier (UDI), including devices classified as different global medical device nomenclature. The use of UDI rather than EDI code as a medical device data source is recommended. We hope that this study will share the current state of medical device data recorded in the EHR and contribute to the introduction of CDM-based medical device vigilance by selecting appropriate medical device data sources.",Preliminary feasibility assessment of CDM-based active surveillance using current status of medical device data in medical records and OMOP-CDM.,,,

It is unknown whether MDD is a comorbidity of BD or its earlier stage, and no consensus exists on individual conversion predictors, delaying BD's timely recognition and treatment. We aimed to build a predictive model of MDD to BD conversion and to validate it across a multi-national network of patient databases using the standardization afforded by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Five ""training"" US databases were retrospectively analyzed: IBM MarketScan CCAE, MDCR, MDCD, Optum EHR, and Optum Claims. Cyclops regularized logistic regression models were developed on one-year MDD-BD conversion with all standard covariates from the HADES PatientLevelPrediction package. Time-to-conversion Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed up to a decade after MDD, stratified by model-estimated risk. External validation of the final prediction model was performed across 9 patient record databases within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network internationally. The model's area under the curve (AUC) varied 0.633-0.745 (micro = 0.689) across the five US training databases. Nine variables predicted one-year MDD-BD transition. Factors that increased risk were: younger age, severe depression, psychosis, anxiety, substance misuse, self-harm thoughts/actions, and prior mental disorder. AUCs of the validation datasets ranged 0.570-0.785 (micro = 0.664).

DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a retrospective cohort study using 15 healthcare databases (primary and secondary electronic healthcare records, insurance and national claims data) from the USA, Europe and South Korea, standardised to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. Data were gathered from 1 March to 31 October 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Two non-mutually exclusive cohorts were defined: (1) individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 (diagnosed cohort) and (2) individuals hospitalised with COVID-19 (hospitalised cohort), and stratified by hypertension status. Follow-up was from COVID-19 diagnosis/hospitalisation to death, end of the study period or 30 days. OUTCOMES: Demographics, comorbidities and 30-day outcomes (hospitalisation and death for the 'diagnosed' cohort and adverse events and death for the 'hospitalised' cohort) were reported. RESULTS: We identified 2 851 035 diagnosed and 563 708 hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Hypertension was more prevalent in the latter (ranging across databases from 17.4% (95% CI 17.2 to 17.6) to 61.4% (95% CI 61.0 to 61.8) and from 25.6% (95% CI 24.6 to 26.6) to 85.9% (95% CI 85.2 to 86.6)). Patients in both cohorts with hypertension were predominantly >50 years old and female. Patients with hypertension were frequently diagnosed with obesity, heart disease, dyslipidaemia and diabetes. Compared with patients without hypertension, patients with hypertension in the COVID-19 diagnosed cohort had more hospitalisations (ranging from 1.3% (95% CI 0.4 to 2.2) to 41.1% (95% CI 39.5 to 42.7) vs from 1.4% (95% CI 0.9 to 1.9) to 15.9% (95% CI 14.9 to 16.9)) and increased mortality (ranging from 0.3% (95% CI 0.1 to 0.5) to 18.5% (95% CI 15.7 to 21.3) vs from 0.2% (95% CI 0.2 to 0.2) to 11.8% (95% CI 10.8 to 12.8)). Patients in the COVID-19 hospitalised cohort with hypertension were more likely to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ranging from 0.1% (95% CI 0.0 to 0.2) to 65.6% (95% CI 62.5 to 68.7) vs from 0.1% (95% CI 0.0 to 0.2) to 54.7% (95% CI 50.5 to 58.9)), arrhythmia (ranging from 0.5% (95% CI 0.3 to 0.7) to 45.8% (95% CI 42.6 to 49.0) vs from 0.4% (95% CI 0.3 to 0.5) to 36.8% (95% CI 32.7 to 40.9)) and increased mortality (ranging from 1.8% (95% CI 0.4 to 3.2) to 25.1% (95% CI 23.0 to 27.2) vs from 0.7% (95% CI 0.5 to 0.9) to 10.9% (95% CI 10.4 to 11.4)) than patients without hypertension.

We aimed to examine the relationship between suicide risk and psychological risk factors such as defense mechanisms, personality, and anxiety. METHODS: We established a psychiatric database by utilizing the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. We conducted a 1:1 propensity score matching with age, sex, and depression severity, and identified a sample (n = 258) with two groups: those with suicidal behavior and those with non-suicidal behavior. Using principal component analysis, we extracted nine psychological scales and applied network analysis to compare relationships among psychological factors between the two groups. RESULTS: Patients with non-suicidal behaviors showed associations between trait anxiety and defense mechanisms, while those with suicidal behaviors did not. For patients with suicidal ideation there was an association between somatization and trait anxiety. Patients with suicide attempts showed associations between paranoia and dissociation connected to trait anxiety. LIMITATIONS: Longitudinal research is required to fully observe transitions from suicidal ideation to attempts and recurrent suicidal events. In addition, these networks may not generalize suicidal behaviors because the group participants are not homogeneous. Lastly, data from self-report questionnaires limits the reliability of responses. CONCLUSIONS: We presented important new insights on suicidal behavior by estimating psychological networks. Patients with non-suicidal behavior may exhibit discrete relationships between defense mechanisms and anxiety, compared to those with suicidal behavior.

We aim to determine the impact, if any, that the choice of development and internal validation design has on the internal performance bias and model generalisability in big data (n~500 000). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Primary and secondary care; three US claims databases. PARTICIPANTS: 1 200 769 patients pharmaceutically treated for their first occurrence of depression. METHODS: We investigated the impact of the development/validation design across 21 real-world prediction questions. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed. We trained LASSO logistic regression models using US claims data and internally validated the models using eight different designs: 'no test/validation set', 'test/validation set' and cross validation with 3-fold, 5-fold or 10-fold with and without a test set. We then externally validated each model in two new US claims databases. We estimated the internal validation bias per design by empirically comparing the differences between the estimated internal performance and external performance. RESULTS: The differences between the models' internal estimated performances and external performances were largest for the 'no test/validation set' design. This indicates even with large data the 'no test/validation set' design causes models to overfit. The seven alternative designs included some validation process to select the hyperparameters and a fair testing process to estimate internal performance. These designs had similar internal performance estimates and performed similarly when externally validated in the two external databases.

We examined the impacts of aspirin, metformin, and statin use on gastric cancer development in a population-based cohort in Korea. METHODS: We analyzed the association between potential chemopreventive drugs-aspirin, metformin, and statin-and gastric cancer through the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model-based Korean nationwide cohort. Use of aspirin, metformin, and statin was defined by >/=365 days of prescriptions for each drug in the general population. To summarize the current evidence, we further performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of aspirin, metformin, and statin on gastric cancer development. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, 31,839, 6764, and 10,251 subjects were observed for medians of 4.7, 4.2, and 4.2 years for aspirin, metformin, and statin analysis, respectively. Use of aspirin or statin was associated with lower risks of gastric cancer compared to their non-use, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] [95% confidence interval [CI]]: aspirin, 0.72 [0.60-0.85], p < 0.01; statin, 0.67 [0.49-0.92], p = 0.01). However, no association was observed between metformin use and gastric cancer development (HR [95% CI]: 0.85 [0.59-1.23], p = 0.40). A subgroup of subjects with diabetes mellitus showed a lower risk of gastric cancer development with statin use. The meta-analysis showed the highest effect size of gastric cancer development for statin, followed by aspirin and metformin.

However, metadata are often incomplete, and there is no standardized format for recording metadata, leading to inefficiency during the metadata-based data retrieval process. Here, we propose a novel standardization method for DICOM metadata termed the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: R-CDM was designed to be compatible with Health Level Seven International (HL7)/Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and linked with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM to achieve a seamless link between clinical data and medical imaging data. The terminology system was standardized using the RadLex playbook, a comprehensive lexicon of radiology. As a proof of concept, the R-CDM conversion process was conducted with 41.7 TB of data from the Ajou University Hospital. The R-CDM database visualizer was developed to visualize the main characteristics of the R-CDM database. RESULTS: Information from 2801360 cases and 87203226 DICOM files was organized into two tables constituting the R-CDM. Information on imaging device and image resolution was recorded with more than 99.9% accuracy. Furthermore, OMOP-CDM and R-CDM were linked to efficiently extract specific types of images from specific patient cohorts. CONCLUSION: R-CDM standardizes the structure and terminology for recording medical imaging data to eliminate incomplete and unstandardized information. Successful standardization was achieved by the extract, transform, and load process and image classifier. We hope that the R-CDM will contribute to deep learning research in the medical imaging field by enabling the securement of large-scale medical imaging data from multinational institutions.",Development and Validation of the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM) for the International Standardization of Medical Imaging Data.,"['Databases, Factual', '*Diagnostic Imaging', 'Humans', 'Radiography', '*Radiology', 'Reference Standards']",,

Existing statistical approaches can be further optimized owing to their high efficiency and low cost. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the proposed approach for use in pharmacovigilance, the early detection of potential ADEs, and the improvement of drug safety. Methods: We developed a novel integrated approach, the Bayesian signal detection algorithm, based on the pharmacological network model (IC(PNM)) using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data published from 2004 to 2009 and from 2014 to 2019Q2, PubChem, and DrugBank database. First, we used a pharmacological network model to generate the probabilities for drug-ADE associations, which comprised the proper prior information component (IC). We then defined the probability of the propensity score adjustment based on a logistic regression model to control for the confounding bias. Finally, we chose the Side Effect Resource (SIDER) and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data to evaluate the detection performance and robustness of the IC(PNM) compared with the statistical approaches [disproportionality analysis (DPA)] by using the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) and Youden's index. Results: Of the statistical approaches implemented, the IC(PNM) showed the best performance (AUC, 0.8291; Youden's index, 0.5836). Meanwhile, the AUCs of the IC, EBGM, ROR, and PRR were 0.7343, 0.7231, 0.6828, and 0.6721, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed IC(PNM) combined the strengths of the pharmacological network model and the Bayesian signal detection algorithm and performed better in detecting true drug-ADE associations. It also detected newer ADE signals than a DPA and may be complementary to the existing statistical approaches.",Combining a Pharmacological Network Model with a Bayesian Signal Detection Algorithm to Improve the Detection of Adverse Drug Events.,,,

However, the coexistence of multiple Common Data Models (CDMs) and the lack of data extract, transform, and load (ETL) tool between different CDMs causes potential interoperability issue between different data systems. The objective of this study is to design, develop, and evaluate an ETL tool that transforms the PCORnet CDM format data into the OMOP CDM. METHODS: We developed an open-source ETL tool to facilitate the data conversion from the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM. The ETL tool was evaluated using a dataset with 1000 patients randomly selected from the PCORnet CDM at Mayo Clinic. Information loss, data mapping accuracy, and gap analysis approaches were conducted to assess the performance of the ETL tool. We designed an experiment to conduct a real-world COVID-19 surveillance task to assess the feasibility of the ETL tool. We also assessed the capacity of the ETL tool for the COVID-19 data surveillance using data collection criteria of the MN EHR Consortium COVID-19 project. RESULTS: After the ETL process, all the records of 1000 patients from 18 PCORnet CDM tables were successfully transformed into 12 OMOP CDM tables. The information loss for all the concept mapping was less than 0.61%. The string mapping process for the unit concepts lost 2.84% records. Almost all the fields in the manual mapping process achieved 0% information loss, except the specialty concept mapping. Moreover, the mapping accuracy for all the fields were 100%. The COVID-19 surveillance task collected almost the same set of cases (99.3% overlaps) from the original PCORnet CDM and target OMOP CDM separately. Finally, all the data elements for MN EHR Consortium COVID-19 project could be captured from both the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that our ETL tool could satisfy the data conversion requirements between the PCORnet CDM and the OMOP CDM. The outcome of the work would facilitate the data retrieval, communication, sharing, and analysis between different institutions for not only COVID-19 related project, but also other real-world evidence-based observational studies.",Developing an ETL tool for converting the PCORnet CDM into the OMOP CDM to facilitate the COVID-19 data integration.,"['*COVID-19/epidemiology', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Pandemics', 'SARS-CoV-2']",,

We developed COVID-19 Estimated Risk (COVER) scores that quantify a patient's risk of hospital admission with pneumonia (COVER-H), hospitalization with pneumonia requiring intensive services or death (COVER-I), or fatality (COVER-F) in the 30-days following COVID-19 diagnosis using historical data from patients with influenza or flu-like symptoms and tested this in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We analyzed a federated network of electronic medical records and administrative claims data from 14 data sources and 6 countries containing data collected on or before 4/27/2020. We used a 2-step process to develop 3 scores using historical data from patients with influenza or flu-like symptoms any time prior to 2020. The first step was to create a data-driven model using LASSO regularized logistic regression, the covariates of which were used to develop aggregate covariates for the second step where the COVER scores were developed using a smaller set of features. These 3 COVER scores were then externally validated on patients with 1) influenza or flu-like symptoms and 2) confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis across 5 databases from South Korea, Spain, and the United States. Outcomes included i) hospitalization with pneumonia, ii) hospitalization with pneumonia requiring intensive services or death, and iii) death in the 30 days after index date. RESULTS: Overall, 44,507 COVID-19 patients were included for model validation. We identified 7 predictors (history of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, kidney disease) which combined with age and sex discriminated which patients would experience any of our three outcomes. The models achieved good performance in influenza and COVID-19 cohorts. For COVID-19 the AUC ranges were, COVER-H: 0.69-0.81, COVER-I: 0.73-0.91, and COVER-F: 0.72-0.90. Calibration varied across the validations with some of the COVID-19 validations being less well calibrated than the influenza validations. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the utility of using a proxy disease to develop a prediction model. The 3 COVER models with 9-predictors that were developed using influenza data perform well for COVID-19 patients for predicting hospitalization, intensive services, and fatality. The scores showed good discriminatory performance which transferred well to the COVID-19 population. There was some miscalibration in the COVID-19 validations, which is potentially due to the difference in symptom severity between the two diseases. A possible solution for this is to recalibrate the models in each location before use.",Seek COVER: using a disease proxy to rapidly develop and validate a personalized risk calculator for COVID-19 outcomes in an international network.,"['*COVID-19', 'COVID-19 Testing', 'Humans', '*Influenza, Human/epidemiology', '*Pneumonia', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'United States']",,

Here, we aimed to replicate and optimise a TPD approach previously used to assess temporal signals of statins with rhabdomyolysis (in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database) by using the OHDSI tools designed for OMOP data sources. METHODS: We used data from the Truven MarketScan US Commercial Claims and the Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE). Using an extension of the OHDSI ICTemporalPatternDiscovery package, we ran positive and negative controls through four analytical settings and calculated sensitivity, specificity, bias and AUC to assess performance. RESULTS: Similar to previous findings, we noted an increase in the Information Component (IC) for simvastatin and rhabdomyolysis following initial exposure and throughout the surveillance window. For example, the change in IC was 0.266 for the surveillance period of 1-30 days as compared to the control period of - 180 to - 1 days. Our modification of the existing OHDSI software allowed for faster queries and more efficient generation of chronographs. CONCLUSION: Our OMOP replication matched the we can account forwe can account for of the original THIN study, only simvastatin had a signal. The TPD method is a useful signal detection tool that provides a single statistic on temporal association and a graphical depiction of the temporal pattern of the drug outcome combination. It remains unclear if the method works well for rare adverse events, but it has been shown to be a useful risk identification tool for longitudinal observational databases. Future work should compare the performance of TPD with other pharmacoepidemiology methods and mining techniques of signal detection.

This study aimed to compare glycemic control and the incidence of hypoglycemia and chronic complications among adult patients with type 2 diabetes prescribed metformin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4I), and sulfonylurea (SU) as monotherapy or dual combination therapy.We retrospectively analyzed propensity-matched cohort data from 3 national university hospitals in Korea. All electronic health records were transformed into a unified Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model and analyzed using ATLAS, an open-source analytical tool, and R software. Glycemic control was assessed as the first observation of a reduction in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level below 7% after prescription of the drug. Differences in the incidence of chronic complications were compared based on the first observation of each complication. Glycemic control and chronic complications were evaluated in patients who maintained the same prescription for at least 3 and 12 months, respectively.Patients who received metformin had lower hazard of reaching HbA1c levels below 7% as compared with those who received SU, and had higher hazard compared with those who received DPP4I (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.98; and HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.42-1.99, respectively). The incidence of hypoglycemia was significantly higher in the SU group than in the metformin and DPP4I groups (metformin vs SU; HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.21-0.43; SU vs DPP4I; HR, 4.42; 95% CI, 2.35-8.31). Metformin + DPP4I had similar hazard of reaching HbA1c levels below 7% compared with metformin + SU (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.99-1.43) and the incidence of hypoglycemia was significantly lower in the metformin + DPP4I group (HR 0.13; 95% CI 0.05-0.30). There was no significant difference in the analysis of the occurrence of chronic complications.SU followed by metformin was effective, and both drugs showed an increased hazard of reaching HbA1c levels below 7% compared with DPP4I. Metformin + DPP4I is comparatively effective for HbA1c level reduction below 7% compared with metformin + SU.

Federated data networks (FDNs) apply novel technology to enable the conduct of RWE studies with multiple partners, without the need to share the individual partner's data set. A systematic review of the published literature was performed to determine which types of research questions can best be addressed through FDNs, specifically in the field of oncology. METHODS: Systematic searches of MEDLINE and Embase were undertaken to identify the types of research questions that had been addressed in studies using FDNs. Additional information was retrieved about study characteristics, statistical methods, and the FDN itself. RESULTS: In total, 40 publications were included where research questions on the following had been addressed (multiple categories possible): disease natural history (58%), safety surveillance (18%), treatment pathways (15%), comparative effectiveness (10%), and cost/resource use studies (3%)-13% of studies had to be left uncategorized. A total of 50% of the studies were run with data partners in networks of </=5. The size of the networks ranged from 227 patients to >5 million patients. Statistical methods used included distributed learning and distributed regression methods.

However, patient privacy laws and institutional regulations complicate geospatial analyses and dissemination of research findings due to protective restrictions in how data and results are shared. This results in infrastructures with great abilities to organize and store healthcare data, yet which lack the innate ability to produce shareable results that preserve privacy and conform to regulatory requirements. Differential privacy is a model for performing privacy-preserving analytics. We detail our process and findings in inserting an open-source library for differential privacy into a workflow for leveraging a geodatabase for geocoding and analyzing geospatial data stored as part of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model.

Researchers have been developing fall risk prediction models and exploring risk factors to provide evidence-based fall prevention practices; however, such efforts are hindered by insufficient samples, limited covariates, and a lack of standardized methodologies that aid study replication. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) convert fall-related electronic health record data into the standardized Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's (OMOP) common data model format and (2) develop models that predict fall risk during 2 time periods. METHODS: As a pilot feasibility test, we converted fall-related electronic health record data (nursing notes, fall risk assessment sheet, patient acuity assessment sheet, and clinical observation sheet) into standardized OMOP common data model format using an extraction, transformation, and load process. We developed fall risk prediction models for 2 time periods (within 7 days of admission and during the entire hospital stay) using 2 algorithms (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression and random forest). RESULTS: In total, 6277 nursing statements, 747,049,486 clinical observation sheet records, 1,554,775 fall risk scores, and 5,685,011 patient acuity scores were converted into OMOP common data model format. All our models (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.692-0.726) performed better than the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model. Patient acuity score, fall history, age >/=60 years, movement disorder, and central nervous system agents were the most important predictors in the logistic regression models. CONCLUSIONS: To enhance model performance further, we are currently converting all nursing records into the OMOP common data model data format, which will then be included in the models. Thus, in the near future, the performance of fall risk prediction models could be improved through the application of abundant nursing records and external validation.",Patient-Level Fall Risk Prediction Using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership's Common Data Model: Pilot Feasibility Study.,,,

The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative is an international data network representing over 1 billion patient records using common data standards. However, few studies have applied OHDSI's Common Data Model (CDM) to the population with epilepsy and none have validated relevant concepts. The goals of this study were to demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing adult patients with epilepsy and ASM treatment pathways using the CDM in an electronic health record (EHR)-derived database. METHODS: We validated a phenotype algorithm for epilepsy in adults using the CDM in an EHR-derived database (2001-2020) against source records and a prospectively maintained database of patients with confirmed epilepsy. We obtained the frequency of all antecedent conditions and procedures for patients meeting the epilepsy phenotype criteria and characterized ASM exposure sequences over time and by age and sex. RESULTS: The phenotype algorithm identified epilepsy with 73.0-85.0% positive predictive value and 86.3% sensitivity. Many patients had neurologic conditions and diagnoses antecedent to meeting epilepsy criteria. Levetiracetam incrementally replaced phenytoin as the most common first-line agent, but significant heterogeneity remained, particularly in second-line and subsequent agents. Drug sequences included up to 8 unique ingredients and a total of 1,235 unique pathways were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of additional ASMs in the last 2 decades and accumulated guidelines and evidence, ASM use varies significantly in practice, particularly for second-line and subsequent agents. Multi-center OHDSI studies have the potential to better characterize the full extent of variability and support observational comparative effectiveness research, but additional work is needed to validate covariates and outcomes.",Patient characteristics and antiseizure medication pathways in newly diagnosed epilepsy: Feasibility and pilot results using the common data model in a single-center electronic medical record database.,"['Databases, Factual', '*Electronic Health Records', '*Epilepsy/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Levetiracetam']",,

The popularity of this concept has fostered the design of a version 2, that better serves real-world requirements and addresses the needs of clinical genomics research and healthcare, as assessed by several contributing projects and organizations. Particularly, rare disease genetics and cancer research will benefit from new case level and genomic variant level requests and the enabling of richer phenotype and clinical queries as well as support for fuzzy searches. Beacon is designed as a ""lingua franca"" to bridge data collections hosted in software solutions with different and rich interfaces. Beacon version 2 works alongside popular standards like Phenopackets, OMOP, or FHIR, allowing implementing consortia to return matches in beacon responses and provide a handover to their preferred data exchange format.

This study aimed to explore the psychiatric outpatient attendance of dementia patients at a psychiatric hospital in China, with particular emphasis on gender differences. METHODS: This retrospective study examined outpatients with dementia from January 2013 to August 2019 using data in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) in Beijing Anding Hospital. Age, sex, number of visits, use of drugs and comorbid conditions were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: Nine thousand four patients were recruited from a specific outpatient clinic of a hospital in Beijing, and the mean number of visits was 6.92. There were 3,433 (38.13%) male patients and 5,571 (61.87%) female patients. The most common comorbidities were generalized anxiety disorder, nonorganic insomnia, delusional disorder and depressive disorder. The proportion of patients using antidementia was the highest, with the rate of 68.3%, followed by benzodiazepines (48.83%), antipsychotics (45.43%), antidepressants (22.24%) and nonbenzodiazepines (19.96%). Patients with dementia showed a significant gender difference in average age (t = 6.36, P < 0.0001). Compared to male patients, female patients had a higher number of visits (7.40 +/- 12.90 vs 6.15 +/- 10.50, t = 4.81, P < 0.0001). There were significant differences in comorbidity composition between male and female patients (t = 23.09, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our present findings suggested significant gender differences in the proportion of age, number of visits and comorbidity composition in outpatients with dementia.",Gender differences in outpatients with dementia from a large psychiatric hospital in China.,"['Comorbidity', '*Dementia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Psychiatric', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Outpatients', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors']",,

Here we present the international Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Characterizing Health Associated Risks and Your Baseline Disease In SARS-COV-2 (CHARYBDIS) framework for standardisation and analysis of COVID-19 RWD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a descriptive retrospective database study using a federated network of data partners in the United States, Europe (the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany, France and Italy) and Asia (South Korea and China). The study protocol and analytical package were released on 11th June 2020 and are iteratively updated via GitHub. We identified three non-mutually exclusive cohorts of 4,537,153 individuals with a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test, 886,193 hospitalized with COVID-19, and 113,627 hospitalized with COVID-19 requiring intensive services. RESULTS: We aggregated over 22,000 unique characteristics describing patients with COVID-19. All comorbidities, symptoms, medications, and outcomes are described by cohort in aggregate counts and are readily available online. Globally, we observed similarities in the USA and Europe: more women diagnosed than men but more men hospitalized than women, most diagnosed cases between 25 and 60 years of age versus most hospitalized cases between 60 and 80 years of age. South Korea differed with more women than men hospitalized. Common comorbidities included type 2 diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and heart disease. Common presenting symptoms were dyspnea, cough and fever. Symptom data availability was more common in hospitalized cohorts than diagnosed. CONCLUSION: We constructed a global, multi-centre view to describe trends in COVID-19 progression, management and evolution over time. By characterising baseline variability in patients and geography, our work provides critical context that may otherwise be misconstrued as data quality issues. This is important as we perform studies on adverse events of special interest in COVID-19 vaccine surveillance.",Unraveling COVID-19: A Large-Scale Characterization of 4.5 Million COVID-19 Cases Using CHARYBDIS.,,,

The aim of this study is to identify the risk of SPM in thyroid cancer (TC) patients with RAI compared with TC patients without RAI from matched cohort. METHODS: Retrospective propensity-matched cohorts were constructed across 4 hospitals in South Korea via the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI), and electrical health records were converted to data of common data model. TC patients who received RAI therapy constituted the target group, whereas TC patients without RAI therapy constituted the comparative group with 1:1 propensity score matching. Hazard ratio (HR) by Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the risk of SPM, and meta-analysis was performed to pool the HRs. RESULTS: Among a total of 24,318 patients, 5,374 patients from each group were analyzed (mean age 48.9 and 49.2, women 79.4% and 79.5% for target and comparative group, respectively). All hazard ratios of SPM in TC patients with RAI therapy were </= 1 based on 95% confidence interval(CI) from full or subgroup analyses according to thyroid cancer stage, time-at-risk period, SPM subtype (hematologic or non-hematologic), and initial age (< 30 years or >/= 30 years). The HR within the target group was not significantly higher (< 1) in patients who received over 3.7 GBq of I-131 compared with patients who received less than 3.7 GBq of I-131 based on 95% CI.

Radiological data are valuable, but imaging metadata are often incomplete, and a standardized recording format in the OMOP-CDM is lacking. We developed a web-based management system and data quality assessment (RQA) tool for a radiology_CDM (R_CDM) and evaluated the feasibility of clinically applying this dataset. METHODS: We designed an R_CDM with Radiology_Occurrence and Radiology_Image tables. This was seamlessly linked to the OMOP-CDM clinical data. We adopted the standardized terminology using the RadLex playbook and mapped 5,753 radiology protocol terms to the OMOP vocabulary. An extract, transform, and load (ETL) process was developed to extract detailed information that was difficult to extract from metadata and to compensate for missing values. Image-based quantification was performed to measure liver surface nodularity (LSN), using customized Wonkwang abdomen and liver total solution (WALTS) software. RESULTS: On a PACS, 368,333,676 DICOM files (1,001,797 cases) were converted to R_CDM chronic liver disease (CLD) data (316,596 MR images, 228 cases; 926,753 CT images, 782 cases) and uploaded to a web-based management system. Acquisition date and resolution were extracted accurately, but other information, such as ""contrast administration status"" and ""photography direction"", could not be extracted from the metadata. Using WALTS, 9,609 pre-contrast axial-plane abdominal MR images (197 CLD cases) were assigned LSN scores by METAVIR fibrosis grades, which differed significantly by ANOVA (p < 0.001). The mean RQA score (83.5) indicated good quality. CONCLUSION: This study developed a web-based system for management of the R_CDM dataset, RQA tool, and constructed a CLD R_CDM dataset, with good quality for clinical application. Our management system and R_CDM CLD dataset would be useful for multicentric and image-based quantification researches.",Development and validation of a management system and dataset quality assessment tool for the Radiology Common Data Model (R_CDM): A case study in liver disease.,,,

The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) is one of the leading common data models. While there is a strong incentive to convert datasets to OMOP, the conversion is time and resource-intensive, leaving the research community in need of tools for mapping data to OMOP. We propose an extract, transform, load (ETL) framework that is metadata-driven and generic across source datasets. The ETL framework uses a new data manipulation language (DML) that organizes SQL snippets in YAML. Our framework includes a compiler that converts YAML files with mapping logic into an ETL script. Access to the ETL framework is available via a web application, allowing users to upload and edit YAML files via web editor and obtain an ETL SQL script for use in development environments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) table of laboratory measurement data-over 3.1 billion patient records and over 19 000 unique measurement concepts in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common-data-model format from 55 data partners. We grouped ontologically similar OMOP concepts together for 52 variables relevant to COVID-19 research, and developed a unit-harmonization pipeline comprised of (1) selecting a canonical unit for each measurement variable, (2) arriving at a formula for conversion, (3) obtaining clinical review of each formula, (4) applying the formula to convert data values in each unit into the target canonical unit, and (5) removing any harmonized value that fell outside of accepted value ranges for the variable. For data with missing units for all the results within a lab test for a data partner, we compared values with pooled values of all data partners, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. RESULTS: Of the concepts without missing values, we harmonized 88.1% of the values, and imputed units for 78.2% of records where units were absent (41% of contributors' records lacked units). DISCUSSION: The harmonization and inference methods developed herein can serve as a resource for initiatives aiming to extract insight from heterogeneous EHR collections.

The timely synthesis and analysis of real-world data could play a key role. OBJECTIVES: The Haematology Outcomes Network in Europe (HONEUR) is a federated data network (FDN) that aims to overcome the challenges of heterogenous data collected from different registries, hospitals, and other databases in different countries. It has the functionality required to analyze data from various sources in a time efficient manner, while preserving local data security and governance. With this, research studies can be performed that can increase knowledge and understanding of the management of patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: HONEUR uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model, which allows analysis scripts to be run by multiple sites using their own data, ultimately generating aggregated results. Furthermore, distributed analytics can be used to run statistical analyses across multiple sites, as if data were pooled. The external governance model ensures high-quality standards, while data ownership is retained locally. Twenty partners from nine countries are now participating, with data from more than 26 000 patients available for analysis. Research questions that can be addressed through HONEUR include assessments of natural disease history, treatment patterns, and clinical effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The HONEUR FDN marks an important step forward in increasing the value of information routinely captured by individual hospitals, registries and other database holders, thus enabling larger-scale studies to be undertaken rapidly and efficiently.","Haematology Outcomes Network in Europe (HONEUR)-A collaborative, interdisciplinary platform to harness the potential of real-world data in hematology.","['Databases, Factual', 'Europe/epidemiology', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', '*Hematology', 'Humans', 'Registries']",,

Predictive modeling has been suggested as a tool to identify high-risk patients. However, existing sepsis readmission models have low predictive value and most predictive factors in such models are not actionable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from patients enrolled in the AllofUs Research Program cohort from 35 hospitals were used to develop a multicenter validated sepsis-related unplanned readmission model that incorporates clinical and social determinants of health (SDH) to predict 30-day unplanned readmissions. Sepsis cases were identified using concepts represented in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership. The dataset included over 60 clinical/laboratory features and over 100 SDH features. RESULTS: Incorporation of SDH factors into our model of clinical and demographic features improves model area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) significantly (from 0.75 to 0.80; P < .001). Model-agnostic interpretability techniques revealed demographics, economic stability, and delay in getting medical care as important SDH predictive features of unplanned hospital readmissions. DISCUSSION: This work represents one of the largest studies of sepsis readmissions using objective clinical data to date (8935 septic index encounters). SDH are important to determine which sepsis patients are more likely to have an unplanned 30-day readmission. The AllofUS dataset provides granular data from a diverse set of individuals, making this model potentially more generalizable than prior models. CONCLUSION: Use of SDH improves predictive performance of a model to identify which sepsis patients are at high risk of an unplanned 30-day readmission.",Inclusion of social determinants of health improves sepsis readmission prediction models.,"['Humans', 'Logistic Models', '*Patient Readmission', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Sepsis', 'Social Determinants of Health']",,

Observations shortly after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 suggested that ibuprofen was associated with an increased risk of adverse events in COVID-19 patients, but subsequent observational studies failed to demonstrate increased risk and in one case showed reduced risk associated with NSAID use. METHODS: A 38-center retrospective cohort study was performed that leveraged the harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative. A propensity-matched cohort of 19,746 COVID-19 inpatients was constructed by matching cases (treated with NSAIDs at the time of admission) and 19,746 controls (not treated) from 857,061 patients with COVID-19 available for analysis. The primary outcome of interest was COVID-19 severity in hospitalized patients, which was classified as: moderate, severe, or mortality/hospice. Secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), invasive ventilation, and all-cause mortality at any time following COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that NSAID use was not associated with increased COVID-19 severity (OR: 0.57 95% CI: 0.53-0.61). Analysis of secondary outcomes using logistic regression showed that NSAID use was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (OR 0.51 95% CI: 0.47-0.56), invasive ventilation (OR: 0.59 95% CI: 0.55-0.64), AKI (OR: 0.67 95% CI: 0.63-0.72), or ECMO (OR: 0.51 95% CI: 0.36-0.7). In contrast, the odds ratios indicate reduced risk of these outcomes, but our quantitative bias analysis showed E-values of between 1.9 and 3.3 for these associations, indicating that comparatively weak or moderate confounder associations could explain away the observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Study interpretation is limited by the observational design. Recording of NSAID use may have been incomplete. Our study demonstrates that NSAID use is not associated with increased COVID-19 severity, all-cause mortality, invasive ventilation, AKI, or ECMO in COVID-19 inpatients. A conservative interpretation in light of the quantitative bias analysis is that there is no evidence that NSAID use is associated with risk of increased severity or the other measured outcomes.

Epub 2022 Jun 7.,2022/05/16 03:31,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,"Background: Combination therapy with liothyronine (LT3) and levothyroxine (LT4) is used in patients with persistent symptoms, despite being administered an adequate dose of LT4. LT3 may also be used in some thyroid cancer patients preparing for radioactive iodine therapy. However, there is a controversy regarding the safety of LT3 use, and there has been no definite evidence of long-term safety of LT3 therapy in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to examine the long-term safety of LT3 therapy using the Common Data Model (CDM). Methods: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study across four hospital databases encoded in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM. LT3 users were defined as those who received an LT3 prescription for at least 90 days (with or without LT4), and their safety outcomes were compared with those in LT4-only users after 1:4 propensity score matching. Safety outcomes included the incidences of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, cancer, anxiety disorder, and mood disorder. Results: We identified 1434 LT3 users and 3908 LT4-only users. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of safety outcomes between LT3 users and LT4-only users. The risks of heart failure (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.664, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.002-2.764, p = 0.049) and stroke (IRR = 1.757, CI 1.073-2.877, p = 0.025) were higher in LT3 users than in LT4-only users. When subgroup analysis was performed according to the presence/absence of thyroid cancer history and duration of thyroid hormone replacement, the risk of heart failure was higher in LT3 users with a history of thyroid cancer and those who underwent >/=52 weeks of LT3 therapy. In addition, the risk of stroke was higher in LT3 users without thyroid cancer history and those who underwent >/=52 weeks of LT3 therapy. Conclusions: The use of LT3 was associated with increased incidence of heart failure and stroke in patients with a longer duration of LT3 use and history of thyroid cancer. Therefore, clinicians should consider the risk of heart failure and stroke in thyroid cancer patients with long-term use of LT3.

Infectious diseases,"BACKGROUND: There are few data on the incidence of thrombosis among COVID-19 cases, with most research concentrated on hospitalised patients. We aimed to estimate the incidence of venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, and death among COVID-19 cases and to assess the impact of these events on the risks of hospitalisation and death. METHODS: We conducted a distributed network cohort study using primary care records from the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and the UK, and outpatient specialist records from Germany. The Spanish database was linked to hospital admissions. Participants were followed up from the date of a diagnosis of COVID-19 or positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (index date) for 90 days. The primary study outcomes were venous thromboembolic events, arterial thromboembolic events, and death, all over the 90 days from the index date. We estimated cumulative incidences for the study outcomes. Multistate models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between venous thromboembolism or arterial thromboembolism occurrence and risks of hospitalisation or COVID-19 fatality. FINDINGS: Overall, 909 473 COVID-19 cases and 32 329 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 on or after Sept 1, 2020, were studied. The latest index dates across the databases ranged from Jan 30, 2021, to July 31, 2021. Cumulative 90-day incidence of venous thromboembolism ranged from 0.2% to 0.8% among COVID-19 cases, and up to 4.5% for those hospitalised. For arterial thromboembolism, estimates ranged from 0.1% to 0.8% among COVID-19 cases, increasing to 3.1% among those hospitalised. Case fatality ranged from 1.1% to 2.0% among patients with COVID-19, rising to 14.6% for hospitalised patients. The occurrence of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of death (adjusted HRs 4.42 [3.07-6.36] for those not hospitalised and 1.63 [1.39-1.90] for those hospitalised), as was the occurrence of arterial thromboembolism (3.16 [2.65-3.75] and 1.93 [1.57-2.37]). INTERPRETATION: Risks of venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboembolism were up to 1% among COVID-19 cases, and increased with age, among males, and in those who were hospitalised. Their occurrence was associated with excess mortality, underlying the importance of developing effective treatment strategies that reduce their frequency.

METHODS: EMRs from January 2013 to December 2016 were mapped onto the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-CDM (OMOP-CDM) schema. Vocabulary mappings were applied to convert source data values into OMOP-CDM-endorsed terminologies. Existing analytic codes used in a prior OMOP-CDM drug utilization study were modified to conduct an illustrative analysis of oral anticoagulants used for atrial fibrillation in Singapore and South Korea, resembling a typical benefit-risk assessment. A novel visualization is proposed to represent the comparative effectiveness, safety and utilization of the drugs. RESULTS: Over 90% of records were mapped onto the OMOP-CDM. The CDM data structures and analytic code templates simplified the querying of data for the analysis. In total, 2,419 patients from Singapore and South Korea fulfilled the study criteria, the majority of whom were warfarin users. After 3 months of follow-up, differences in cumulative incidence of bleeding and thromboembolic events were observable via the proposed visualization, surfacing insights as to the agent of preference in a given clinical setting, which may meaningfully inform regulatory decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: While the structure of the OMOP-CDM and its accessory tools facilitate real-world data analysis, extending them to fulfil regulatory analytic purposes in the post-market setting, such as benefit-risk assessments, may require layering on additional analytic tools and visualization techniques.",Applying the OMOP Common Data Model to Facilitate Benefit-Risk Assessments of Medicinal Products Using Real-World Data from Singapore and South Korea.,,,

Epub 2022 May 17.,2022/05/17 11:18,Drug safety,"INTRODUCTION: External validation of prediction models is increasingly being seen as a minimum requirement for acceptance in clinical practice. However, the lack of interoperability of healthcare databases has been the biggest barrier to this occurring on a large scale. Recent improvements in database interoperability enable a standardized analytical framework for model development and external validation. External validation of a model in a new database lacks context, whereby the external validation can be compared with a benchmark in this database. Iterative pairwise external validation (IPEV) is a framework that uses a rotating model development and validation approach to contextualize the assessment of performance across a network of databases. As a use case, we predicted 1-year risk of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The method follows a two-step process involving (1) development of baseline and data-driven models in each database according to best practices and (2) validation of these models across the remaining databases. We introduce a heatmap visualization that supports the assessment of the internal and external model performance in all available databases. As a use case, we developed and validated models to predict 1-year risk of heart failure in patients initializing a second pharmacological intervention for type 2 diabetes mellitus. We leveraged the power of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model to create an open-source software package to increase the consistency, speed, and transparency of this process. RESULTS: A total of 403,187 patients from five databases were included in the study. We developed five models that, when assessed internally, had a discriminative performance ranging from 0.73 to 0.81 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with acceptable calibration. When we externally validated these models in a new database, three models achieved consistent performance and in context often performed similarly to models developed in the database itself. The visualization of IPEV provided valuable insights. From this, we identified the model developed in the Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) database as the best performing model overall. CONCLUSION: Using IPEV lends weight to the model development process. The rotation of development through multiple databases provides context to model assessment, leading to improved understanding of transportability and generalizability. The inclusion of a baseline model in all modelling steps provides further context to the performance gains of increasing model complexity. The CCAE model was identified as a candidate for clinical use. The use case demonstrates that IPEV provides a huge opportunity in a new era of standardised data and analytics to improve insight into and trust in prediction models at an unprecedented scale.",Using Iterative Pairwise External Validation to Contextualize Prediction Model Performance: A Use Case Predicting 1-Year Heart Failure Risk in Patients with Diabetes Across Five Data Sources.,"['Databases, Factual', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology', '*Heart Failure/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Software']",,

Digital health,"BACKGROUND: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as long COVID, have severely affected recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic for patients and society alike. Long COVID is characterised by evolving, heterogeneous symptoms, making it challenging to derive an unambiguous definition. Studies of electronic health records are a crucial element of the US National Institutes of Health's RECOVER Initiative, which is addressing the urgent need to understand long COVID, identify treatments, and accurately identify who has it-the latter is the aim of this study. METHODS: Using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative's (N3C) electronic health record repository, we developed XGBoost machine learning models to identify potential patients with long COVID. We defined our base population (n=1 793 604) as any non-deceased adult patient (age >/=18 years) with either an International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification COVID-19 diagnosis code (U07.1) from an inpatient or emergency visit, or a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test, and for whom at least 90 days have passed since COVID-19 index date. We examined demographics, health-care utilisation, diagnoses, and medications for 97 995 adults with COVID-19. We used data on these features and 597 patients from a long COVID clinic to train three machine learning models to identify potential long COVID among all patients with COVID-19, patients hospitalised with COVID-19, and patients who had COVID-19 but were not hospitalised. Feature importance was determined via Shapley values. We further validated the models on data from a fourth site. FINDINGS: Our models identified, with high accuracy, patients who potentially have long COVID, achieving areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.92 (all patients), 0.90 (hospitalised), and 0.85 (non-hospitalised). Important features, as defined by Shapley values, include rate of health-care utilisation, patient age, dyspnoea, and other diagnosis and medication information available within the electronic health record. INTERPRETATION: Patients identified by our models as potentially having long COVID can be interpreted as patients warranting care at a specialty clinic for long COVID, which is an essential proxy for long COVID diagnosis as its definition continues to evolve. We also achieve the urgent goal of identifying potential long COVID in patients for clinical trials. As more data sources are identified, our models can be retrained and tuned based on the needs of individual studies.

We trained prediction models for calculating patients' individual risk of complications based only on preoperatively available data in a multidisciplinary team setting. Knowing prior to surgery the probability of developing a complication could aid in improving informed decision-making by surgeon and patient and individualize surgical treatment trajectories. METHODS: All patients over 18 years of age undergoing any resection for colorectal cancer between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2019 from the nationwide Danish Colorectal Cancer Group database were included. Data from the database were converted into Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model maintained by the Observation Health Data Science and Informatics initiative. Multiple machine learning models were trained to predict postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo grade >/= 3B and anastomotic leakage within 30 days after surgery. RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2019, 23,907 patients underwent resection for colorectal cancer in Denmark. A Clavien-Dindo complication grade >/= 3B occurred in 2,958 patients (12.4%). Of 17,190 patients that received an anastomosis, 929 experienced anastomotic leakage (5.4%). Among the compared machine learning models, Lasso Logistic Regression performed best. The predictive model for complications had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.704 (95%CI 0.683-0.724) and an AUROC of 0.690 (95%CI 0.655-0.724) for anastomotic leakage. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction of postoperative complications based only on preoperative variables using a national quality assurance colorectal cancer database shows promise for calculating patient's individual risk. Future work will focus on assessing the value of adding laboratory parameters and drug exposure as candidate predictors.

METHODS: Data of electronic health records from ten hospitals converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (n = 14,605,368 patients) were used to identify new users of pitavastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin (atorvastatin + rosuvastatin) for >/= 180 days without a previous history of diabetes or HbA1c level >/= 5.7%. We conducted a cohort study using Cox regression analysis to examine the hazard ratio (HR) of NODM after propensity score matching (PSM) and then performed an aggregate meta-analysis of the HR. RESULTS: After 1:2 PSM, 10,238 new pitavastatin users (15,998 person-years of follow-up) and 18,605 atorvastatin + rosuvastatin users (33,477 person-years of follow-up) were pooled from 10 databases. The meta-analysis of the HRs demonstrated that pitavastatin resulted in a significantly reduced risk of NODM than atorvastatin + rosuvastatin (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.59-0.87). In sub-analysis, pitavastatin was associated with a lower risk of NODM than atorvastatin or rosuvastatin after 1:1 PSM (HR 0.69; CI 0.54-0.88 and HR 0.74; CI 0.55-0.99, respectively). A consistently low risk of NODM in pitavastatin users was observed when compared with low-to-moderate-intensity atorvastatin + rosuvastatin users (HR 0.78; CI 0.62-0.98). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective, multicenter active-comparator, new-user, cohort study, pitavastatin reduced the risk of NODM compared with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin.",Impact of pitavastatin on new-onset diabetes mellitus compared to atorvastatin and rosuvastatin: a distributed network analysis of 10 real-world databases.,"['Atorvastatin/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', '*Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Quinolines', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rosuvastatin Calcium/adverse effects']",,

Those research networks have become increasingly relevant in recent years; not least due to the special situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. An important requirement for those networks is the data harmonization by ensuring the semantic interoperability. Aims: In this paper we demonstrate (1) how to facilitate digital infrastructures to run a retrospective study in a research network spread across university and non-university hospital sites; and (2) to answer a medical question on COVID-19 related change in diagnostic counts for diabetes-related eye diseases. Materials and methods: The study is retrospective and non-interventional and runs on medical case data documented in routine care at the participating sites. The technical infrastructure consists of the OMOP CDM and other OHDSI tools that is provided in a transferable format. An ETL process to transfer and harmonize the data to the OMOP CDM has been utilized. Cohort definitions for each year in observation have been created centrally and applied locally against medical case data of all participating sites and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results: The analyses showed an expectable drop of the total number of diagnoses and the diagnoses for diabetes in general; whereas the number of diagnoses for diabetes-related eye diseases surprisingly decreased stronger compared to non-eye diseases. Differences in relative changes of diagnoses counts between sites show an urgent need to process multi-centric studies rather than single-site studies to reduce bias in the data. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated the ability to utilize an existing portable and standardized infrastructure and ETL process from a university hospital setting and transfer it to non-university sites. From a medical perspective further activity is needed to evaluate data quality of the utilized real-world data documented in routine care and to investigate its eligibility of this data for research.,Opportunities of Digital Infrastructures for Disease Management-Exemplified on COVID-19-Related Change in Diagnosis Counts for Diabetes-Related Eye Diseases.,"['*COVID-19/diagnosis', 'Databases, Factual', '*Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis/therapy', 'Disease Management', '*Eye Diseases/diagnosis/therapy', 'Humans', 'Pandemics', 'Retrospective Studies']",,

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we explored the pre-pandemic co-occurrence of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia (TWT) using 17 observational health data sources across the world. We applied multiple TWT definitions, estimated the background rate of TWT, characterized TWT patients, and explored the makeup of thrombosis types among TWT patients. METHODS: We conducted an international network retrospective cohort study using electronic health records and insurance claims data, estimating background rates of TWT amongst persons observed from 2017 to 2019. Following the principles of existing VITT clinical definitions, TWT was defined as patients with a diagnosis of embolic or thrombotic arterial or venous events and a diagnosis or measurement of thrombocytopenia within 7 days. Six TWT phenotypes were considered, which varied in the approach taken in defining thrombosis and thrombocytopenia in real world data. RESULTS: Overall TWT incidence rates ranged from 1.62 to 150.65 per 100,000 person-years. Substantial heterogeneity exists across data sources and by age, sex, and alternative TWT phenotypes. TWT patients were likely to be men of older age with various comorbidities. Among the thrombosis types, arterial thrombotic events were the most common. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that identifying VITT in observational data presents a substantial challenge, as implementing VITT case definitions based on the co-occurrence of TWT results in large and heterogeneous incidence rate and in a cohort of patints with baseline characteristics that are inconsistent with the VITT cases reported to date.",Phenotype Algorithms for the Identification and Characterization of Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia in Real World Data: A Multinational Network Cohort Study.,"['Algorithms', '*COVID-19', '*COVID-19 Vaccines/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Thrombosis/chemically induced/etiology']",,

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The large-scale evidence generations across a network of databases for T2DM (LEGEND-T2DM) initiative is a series of systematic, large-scale, multinational, real-world comparative cardiovascular effectiveness and safety studies of all four major second-line anti-hyperglycaemic agents, including sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and sulfonylureas. LEGEND-T2DM will leverage the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community that provides access to a global network of administrative claims and electronic health record data sources, representing 190 million patients in the USA and about 50 million internationally. LEGEND-T2DM will identify all adult, patients with T2DM who newly initiate a traditionally second-line T2DM agent. Using an active comparator, new-user cohort design, LEGEND-T2DM will execute all pairwise class-versus-class and drug-versus-drug comparisons in each data source, producing extensive study diagnostics that assess reliability and generalisability through cohort balance and equipoise to examine the relative risk of cardiovascular and safety outcomes. The primary cardiovascular outcomes include a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events and a series of safety outcomes. The study will pursue data-driven, large-scale propensity adjustment for measured confounding, a large set of negative control outcome experiments to address unmeasured and systematic bias. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study ensures data safety through a federated analytic approach and follows research best practices, including prespecification and full disclosure of results. LEGEND-T2DM is dedicated to open science and transparency and will publicly share all analytic code from reproducible cohort definitions through turn-key software, enabling other research groups to leverage our methods, data and results to verify and extend our findings.","Large-scale evidence generation and evaluation across a network of databases for type 2 diabetes mellitus (LEGEND-T2DM): a protocol for a series of multinational, real-world comparative cardiovascular effectiveness and safety studies.","['Adult', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/chemically induced/drug therapy', '*Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/adverse effects', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Sulfonylurea Compounds/therapeutic use']",,

We addressed this using a large-scale network cohort study in the United States (US), Belgium, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: We used nine databases (claims or electronic health records) that had been converted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model with analysis performed using open-source analytical tools. We identified adults with AF and a first OAC prescription, either vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), from 2010 to 2017. We described time trends in use, continuation, and switching. RESULTS: In 2010, 87.5%-99.8% of patients started on a VKA. By 2017, the majority started on a DOAC: 87.0% (US), 88.3% (Belgium), 93.1% (France), 88.4% (Germany), and 86.1%-86.7% (UK). In the UK, DOACs became the most common starting OAC in 2015, 2-3 years later than elsewhere. Apixaban was the most common starting OAC by 2017, 50.2%-57.8% (US), 31.4% (Belgium), 45.9% (France), 39.5% (Germany), and 49.8%-50.5% (UK), followed by rivaroxaban, 24.8%-32.5% (US), 25.7% (Belgium), 38.4% (France), 24.9% (Germany), and 30.2%-31.2% (UK). Long-term treatment was less common in the US than in Europe, especially the UK. A minority of patients switched from their index OAC in the short and long term. CONCLUSIONS: From 2010 to 2017, VKA use had significantly declined and DOAC use had significantly increased in the US and Europe.

However, the information is primarily stored as either a full or semistructured free-text clinical document which is limiting the data use. By transforming the cancer-specific data to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM), the information can contribute to establish multicenter observational cancer studies. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies on OMOP CDM transformation and natural language processing (NLP) for thyroid cancer to date. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to demonstrate the applicability of the OMOP CDM oncology extension module for thyroid cancer diagnosis and cancer stage information by processing free-text medical reports. METHODS: Thyroid cancer diagnosis and stage-related modifiers were extracted with rule-based NLP from 63,795 thyroid cancer pathology reports and 56,239 Iodine whole-body scan reports from three medical institutions in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics data network. The data were converted into the OMOP CDM v6.0 according to the OMOP CDM oncology extension module. The cancer staging group was derived and populated using the transformed CDM data. RESULTS: The extracted thyroid cancer data were completely converted into the OMOP CDM. The distributions of histopathological types of thyroid cancer were approximately 95.3 to 98.8% of papillary carcinoma, 0.9 to 3.7% of follicular carcinoma, 0.04 to 0.54% of adenocarcinoma, 0.17 to 0.81% of medullary carcinoma, and 0 to 0.3% of anaplastic carcinoma. Regarding cancer staging, stage-I thyroid cancer accounted for 55 to 64% of the cases, while stage III accounted for 24 to 26% of the cases. Stage-II and -IV thyroid cancers were detected at a low rate of 2 to 6%. CONCLUSION: As a first study on OMOP CDM transformation and NLP for thyroid cancer, this study will help other institutions to standardize thyroid cancer-specific data for retrospective observational research and participate in multicenter studies.",Transforming Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis and Staging Information from Unstructured Reports to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership Common Data Model.,"['*Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Thyroid Neoplasms/diagnosis']",,

We aimed to develop and validate prediction models for a variety of adverse health outcomes in RA patients initiating first-line methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy. METHODS: Data from 15 claims and electronic health record databases across 9 countries were used. Models were developed and internally validated on Optum(R) De-identified Clinformatics(R) Data Mart Database using L1-regularized logistic regression to estimate the risk of adverse health outcomes within 3 months (leukopenia, pancytopenia, infection), 2 years (myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke), and 5 years (cancers [colorectal, breast, uterine] after treatment initiation. Candidate predictors included demographic variables and past medical history. Models were externally validated on all other databases. Performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots. FINDINGS: Models were developed and internally validated on 21,547 RA patients and externally validated on 131,928 RA patients. Models for serious infection (AUC: internal 0.74, external ranging from 0.62 to 0.83), MI (AUC: internal 0.76, external ranging from 0.56 to 0.82), and stroke (AUC: internal 0.77, external ranging from 0.63 to 0.95), showed good discrimination and adequate calibration. Models for the other outcomes showed modest internal discrimination (AUC < 0.65) and were not externally validated. INTERPRETATION: We developed and validated prediction models for a variety of adverse health outcomes in RA patients initiating first-line MTX monotherapy. Final models for serious infection, MI, and stroke demonstrated good performance across multiple databases and can be studied for clinical use.

Understanding the seasonality of a biological event can contribute to an improved understanding of its causes and help guide appropriate responses. Observational data, however, are not comprised of biological events, but timestamped diagnosis codes the combination of which (along with additional requirements) are used as proxies for biological events. As there exist different methods for determining the seasonality of a time series, it is necessary to know if these methods exhibit concordance. In this study we seek to determine the concordance of these methods by applying them to time series derived from diagnosis codes in observational data residing in databases that vary in size, type, and provenance. METHODS: We compared 8 methods for determining the seasonality of a time series at three levels of significance (0.01, 0.05, and 0.1), against 10 observational health databases. We evaluated 61,467 time series at each level of significance, totaling 184,401 evaluations. RESULTS: Across all databases and levels of significance, concordance ranged from 20.2 to 40.2%. Across all databases and levels of significance, the proportion of time series classified seasonal ranged from 4.9 to 88.3%. For each database and level of significance, we computed the difference between the maximum and minimum proportion of time series classified seasonal by all methods. The median within-database difference was 54.8, 34.7, and 39.8%, for p < 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methods of binary seasonality classification when applied to time series derived from diagnosis codes in observational health data produce inconsistent results. The methods exhibit considerable discord within all databases, implying that the discord is a result of the difference between the methods themselves and not due to the choice of database. The results indicate that researchers relying on automated methods to assess the seasonality of time series derived from diagnosis codes in observational data should be aware that the methods are not interchangeable and thus the choice of method can affect the generalizability of their work. Seasonality determination is highly dependent on the method chosen.",Empirical assessment of alternative methods for identifying seasonality in observational healthcare data.,"['Data Collection', 'Databases, Factual', '*Delivery of Health Care', 'Humans', '*Research Design', 'Seasons']",,

To monitor these, pooled analyses may be needed. However, variation in terminologies present a barrier as England uses the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), while the rest of the United Kingdom uses the Read v2 terminology in primary care. The availability of data sources is not uniform across the United Kingdom. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use the concept mappings in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) to identify common concepts recorded and to report these in a repeated cross-sectional study. We planned to do this for vaccine coverage and 2 adverse events of interest (AEIs), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and anaphylaxis. We identified concept mappings to SNOMED CT, Read v2, the World Health Organization's International Classification of Disease Tenth Revision (ICD-10) terminology, and the UK Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d). METHODS: Exposures and outcomes of interest to DaC-VaP for pharmacovigilance studies were selected. Mappings of these variables to different terminologies used across the United Kingdom's devolved nations' health services were identified from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Automated Terminology Harmonization, Extraction, and Normalization for Analytics (ATHENA) online browser. Lead analysts from each nation then confirmed or added to the mappings identified. These mappings were then used to report AEIs in a common format. We reported rates for windows of 0-2 and 3-28 days postvaccine every 28 days. RESULTS: We listed the mappings between Read v2, SNOMED CT, ICD-10, and dm+d. For vaccine exposure, we found clear mapping from OMOP to our clinical terminologies, though dm+d had codes not listed by OMOP at the time of searching. We found a list of CVST and anaphylaxis codes. For CVST, we had to use a broader cerebral venous thrombosis conceptual approach to include Read v2. We identified 56 SNOMED CT codes, of which we selected 47 (84%), and 15 Read v2 codes. For anaphylaxis, our refined search identified 60 SNOMED CT codes and 9 Read v2 codes, of which we selected 10 (17%) and 4 (44%), respectively, to include in our repeated cross-sectional studies. CONCLUSIONS: This approach enables the use of mappings to different terminologies within the OMOP CDM without the need to catalogue an entire database. However, Read v2 has less granular concepts than some terminologies, such as SNOMED CT. Additionally, the OMOP CDM cannot compensate for limitations in the clinical coding system. Neither Read v2 nor ICD-10 is sufficiently granular to enable CVST to be specifically flagged. Hence, any pooled analysis will have to be at the less specific level of cerebrovascular venous thrombosis. Overall, the mappings within this CDM are useful, and our method could be used for rapid collaborations where there are only a limited number of concepts to pool.",Methodological Issues in Using a Common Data Model of COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake and Important Adverse Events of Interest: Feasibility Study of Data and Connectivity COVID-19 Vaccines Pharmacovigilance in the United Kingdom.,,,

This has led to an increase in observational study, as well as to the threat of privacy invasion. Recently, a distributed research network based on the common data model (CDM) has emerged, enabling collaborative international medical research without sharing patient-level data. Although the CDM database for each institution is built inside a firewall, the risk of re-identification requires management. Hence, this study aims to elucidate the perceptions CDM users have towards CDM and risk management for re-identification. METHODS: The survey, targeted to answer specific in-depth questions on CDM, was conducted from October to November 2020. We targeted well-experienced researchers who actively use CDM. Basic statistics (total number and percent) were computed for all covariates. RESULTS: There were 33 valid respondents. Of these, 43.8% suggested additional anonymization was unnecessary beyond, ""minimum cell count"" policy, which obscures a cell with a value lower than certain number (usually 5) in shared results to minimize the liability of re-identification due to rare conditions. During extract-transform-load processes, 81.8% of respondents assumed structured data is under control from the risk of re-identification. However, respondents noted that date of birth and death were highly re-identifiable information. The majority of respondents (n = 22, 66.7%) conceded the possibility of identifier-contained unstructured data in the NOTE table. CONCLUSION: Overall, CDM users generally attributed high reliability for privacy protection to the intrinsic nature of CDM. There was little demand for additional de-identification methods. However, unstructured data in the CDM were suspected to have risks. The necessity for a coordinating consortium to define and manage the re-identification risk of CDM was urged.",Perceived Risk of Re-Identification in OMOP-CDM Database: A Cross-Sectional Survey.,"['*Biomedical Research', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,

A recent observational study found an increased risk of hip fracture in subjects who were new users of tramadol compared with codeine. These drugs have somewhat different indications. Tramadol is indicated for moderate to severe pain and can be used for an extended period; codeine is indicated for mild to moderate pain and cough suppression. OBJECTIVE: In this observational study, we compared the risk of hip fracture in new users of tramadol or codeine, using multiple databases and analytical methods. METHODS: Using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and three US claims databases, we compared the risk of hip fracture after exposure to tramadol or codeine in subjects aged 50-89 years. To ensure comparability, large-scale propensity scores were used to adjust for confounding. RESULTS: We observed a calibrated hazard ratio of 1.10 (95% calibrated confidence interval 0.99-1.21) in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink database, and a pooled estimate across the US databases yielded a calibrated hazard ratio of 1.06 (95% calibrated confidence interval 0.97-1.16).

Epub 2022 Jul 18.,2022/07/18 11:16,International journal of colorectal disease,"PURPOSE: The majority of colorectal cancer surgeries are performed electively, and treatment is often decided at the multidisciplinary team conference. Although the average 30-day mortality rate is low, there is substantial population heterogeneity from young, healthy patients to frail, elderly patients. The individual risk of surgery can vary widely, and tailoring treatment for colorectal cancer may lead to better outcomes. This requires prediction of risk that is accurate and available prior to surgery. METHODS: Data from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group database was transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Models were developed to predict the risk of mortality within 30, 90, and 180 days after colorectal cancer surgery using only covariates decided at the multidisciplinary team conference. Several machine-learning models were trained, but due to superior performance, a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator logistic regression was used for the final model. Performance was assessed with discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curve) and calibration measures (calibration in large, intercept, slope, and Brier score). RESULTS: The cohort contained 65,612 patients operated for colorectal cancer in the period from 2001 to 2019 in Denmark. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic for 30-, 90-, and 180-day mortality after colorectal cancer surgery of 0.871 (95% CI: 0.86-0.882), 0.874 (95% CI: 0.864-0.882), and 0.876 (95% CI: 0.867-0.883) and calibration in large of 1.01, 0.98, and 1.01, respectively.

However, its use as a standard for health research is still less prevalent. To use existing data sources more efficiently for health research, data interoperability becomes increasingly important. FHIR provides solutions by offering resource domains such as ""Public Health & Research"" and ""Evidence-Based Medicine"" while using already established web technologies. Therefore, FHIR could help standardize data across different data sources and improve interoperability in health research. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to provide a systematic review of existing literature and determine the current state of FHIR implementations in health research and possible future directions. METHODS: We searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and Cochrane Library databases for studies published from 2011 to 2022. Studies investigating the use of FHIR in health research were included. Articles published before 2011, abstracts, reviews, editorials, and expert opinions were excluded. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and registered this study with PROSPERO (CRD42021235393). Data synthesis was done in tables and figures. RESULTS: We identified a total of 998 studies, of which 49 studies were eligible for inclusion. Of the 49 studies, most (73%, n=36) covered the domain of clinical research, whereas the remaining studies focused on public health or epidemiology (6%, n=3) or did not specify their research domain (20%, n=10). Studies used FHIR for data capture (29%, n=14), standardization of data (41%, n=20), analysis (12%, n=6), recruitment (14%, n=7), and consent management (4%, n=2). Most (55%, 27/49) of the studies had a generic approach, and 55% (12/22) of the studies focusing on specific medical specialties (infectious disease, genomics, oncology, environmental health, imaging, and pulmonary hypertension) reported their solutions to be conferrable to other use cases. Most (63%, 31/49) of the studies reported using additional data models or terminologies: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (29%, n=14), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (37%, n=18), International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (18%, n=9), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (12%, n=6), and others (43%, n=21). Only 4 (8%) studies used a FHIR resource from the domain ""Public Health & Research."" Limitations using FHIR included the possible change in the content of FHIR resources, safety, legal matters, and the need for a FHIR server. CONCLUSIONS: Our review found that FHIR can be implemented in health research, and the areas of application are broad and generalizable in most use cases. The implementation of international terminologies was common, and other standards such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model could be used as a complement to FHIR. Limitations such as the change of FHIR content, lack of FHIR implementation, safety, and legal matters need to be addressed in future releases to expand the use of FHIR and, therefore, interoperability in health research.",Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for Interoperability in Health Research: Systematic Review.,,,

Methods: Using three claims and one EHR database, we evaluate several variants of the case-control, comparative cohort, historical comparator, and self-controlled designs against historical vaccinations using real negative control outcomes (outcomes with no evidence to suggest that they could be caused by the vaccines) and simulated positive control outcomes. Results: Most methods show large type 1 error, often identifying false positive signals. The cohort method appears either positively or negatively biased, depending on the choice of comparator index date. Empirical calibration using effect-size estimates for negative control outcomes can bring type 1 error closer to nominal, often at the cost of increasing type 2 error. After calibration, the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design most rapidly detects small true effect sizes, while the historical comparator performs well for strong effects. Conclusion: When applying any method for vaccine safety surveillance we recommend considering the potential for systematic error, especially due to confounding, which for many designs appears to be substantial. Adjusting for age and sex alone is likely not sufficient to address differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated, and for the cohort method the choice of index date is important for the comparability of the groups. Analysis of negative control outcomes allows both quantification of the systematic error and, if desired, subsequent empirical calibration to restore type 1 error to its nominal value. In order to detect weaker signals, one may have to accept a higher type 1 error.",Vaccine Safety Surveillance Using Routinely Collected Healthcare Data-An Empirical Evaluation of Epidemiological Designs.,,,

Modifying the existing WHO Clinical Progression Scale, we developed an ordinal severity scale (OS) and assessed its usefulness in the analyses of COVID-19 patient outcomes using retrospective EHR data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An OS was developed to assign COVID-19 disease severity using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model within the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) data enclave. We then evaluated usefulness of the developed OS using heterogenous EHR data from January 2020 to October 2021 submitted to N3C by 63 healthcare organizations across the United States. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to characterize changes in disease severity among patients during the 28-day period following COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: The data set used in this analysis consists of 2 880 456 patients. PCA of the day-to-day variation in OS levels over the totality of the 28-day period revealed contrasting patterns of variation in disease severity within the first and second 14 days and illustrated the importance of evaluation over the full 28-day period. DISCUSSION: An OS with well-defined, robust features, based on discrete EHR data elements, is useful for assessments of COVID-19 patient outcomes, providing insights on the progression of COVID-19 disease severity over time. CONCLUSIONS: The OS provides a framework that can facilitate better understanding of the course of acute COVID-19, informing clinical decision-making and resource allocation.",An ordinal severity scale for COVID-19 retrospective studies using Electronic Health Record data.,,,

The data warehouse stores historical and accurate data with an accuracy level of the day for administrative data, and of the second for monitoring data. Datamarts complete the architecture and provide secondary computed data and indicators, in order to execute queries faster and easily. Between 2010 and 2021, 636 784 anesthesia records were integrated for 353 152 patients. We reported the main concerns and barriers during the development of this project and we provided 8 tips to handle them. We have implemented our data warehouse into the OMOP common data model as a complementary downstream data model.

Unfortunately, those data are fragmented in silos with different data structures or formats and cannot be used to improve understanding of the disease, monitor its progress, and generate evidence to guide prevention measures. The objective of this project is to leverage the artificial intelligence (AI) and data science techniques in harmonizing datasets to support Rwandan government needs in monitoring and predicting the COVID-19 burden, including the hospital admissions and overall infection rates. METHODS: The project will gather the existing data including hospital electronic health records (EHRs), the COVID-19 testing data and will link with longitudinal data from community surveys. The open-source tools from Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) will be used to harmonize hospital EHRs through the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). The project will also leverage other OHDSI tools for data analytics and network integration, as well as R Studio and Python. The network will include up to 15 health facilities in Rwanda, whose EHR data will be harmonized to OMOP CDM. EXPECTED RESULTS: This study will yield a technical infrastructure where the 15 participating hospitals and health centres will have EHR data in OMOP CDM format on a local Mac Mini (""data node""), together with a set of OHDSI open-source tools. A central server, or portal, will contain a data catalogue of participating sites, as well as the OHDSI tools that are used to define and manage distributed studies. The central server will also integrate the information from the national Covid-19 registry, as well as the results of the community surveys. The ultimate project outcome is the dynamic prediction modelling for COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda. DISCUSSION: The project is the first on the African continent leveraging AI and implementation of an OMOP CDM based federated data network for data harmonization. Such infrastructure is scalable for other pandemics monitoring, outcomes predictions, and tailored response planning.","Leveraging artificial intelligence and data science techniques in harmonizing, sharing, accessing and analyzing SARS-COV-2/COVID-19 data in Rwanda (LAISDAR Project): study design and rationale.","['Artificial Intelligence', '*COVID-19/epidemiology', 'COVID-19 Testing', 'Data Science', 'Humans', 'Pandemics/prevention & control', 'Rwanda/epidemiology', '*SARS-CoV-2']",,

Our primary objective was to evaluate the association between GI symptoms and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: In this nationwide cohort of US veterans, we evaluated GI symptoms (nausea/vomiting/diarrhea) reported 30 days before and including the date of positive SARS-CoV-2 testing (March 1, 2020, to February 20, 2021). All patients had >/=1 year of prior baseline data and >/=60 days follow-up relative to the test date. We used propensity score (PS)-weighting to balance covariates in patients with vs without GI symptoms. The primary composite outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or death within 60 days of positive testing. RESULTS: Of 218,045 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 29,257 (13.4%) had GI symptoms. After PS weighting, all covariates were balanced. In the PS-weighted cohort, patients with vs without GI symptoms had severe COVID-19 more often (29.0% vs 17.1%; P < .001). When restricted to hospitalized patients (14.9%; n=32,430), patients with GI symptoms had similar frequencies of intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation compared with patients without symptoms. There was a significant age interaction; among hospitalized patients aged >/=70 years, lower COVID-19-associated mortality was observed in patients with vs without GI symptoms, even after accounting for COVID-19-specific medical treatments. CONCLUSION: In the largest integrated US health care system, SARS-CoV-2-positive patients with GI symptoms experienced severe COVID-19 outcomes more often than those without symptoms. Additional research on COVID-19-associated GI symptoms may inform preventive efforts and interventions to reduce severe COVID-19.",Associations Between Gastrointestinal Symptoms and COVID-19 Severity Outcomes Based on a Propensity Score-Weighted Analysis of a Nationwide Cohort.,,,

Epub 2022 Aug 19.,2022/08/22 19:23,Journal of biomedical informatics,"PURPOSE: Phenotype algorithms are central to performing analyses using observational data. These algorithms translate the clinical idea of a health condition into an executable set of rules allowing for queries of data elements from a database. PheValuator, a software package in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tool stack, provides a method to assess the performance characteristics of these algorithms, namely, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value. It uses machine learning to develop predictive models for determining a probabilistic gold standard of subjects for assessment of cases and non-cases of health conditions. PheValuator was developed to complement or even replace the traditional approach of algorithm validation, i.e., by expert assessment of subject records through chart review. Results in our first PheValuator paper suggest a systematic underestimation of the PPV compared to previous results using chart review. In this paper we evaluate modifications made to the method designed to improve its performance. METHODS: The major changes to PheValuator included allowing all diagnostic conditions, clinical observations, drug prescriptions, and laboratory measurements to be included as predictors within the modeling process whereas in the prior version there were significant restrictions on the included predictors. We also have allowed for the inclusion of the temporal relationships of the predictors in the model. To evaluate the performance of the new method, we compared the results from the new and original methods against results found from the literature using traditional validation of algorithms for 19 phenotypes. We performed these tests using data from five commercial databases. RESULTS: In the assessment aggregating all phenotype algorithms, the median difference between the PheValuator estimate and the gold standard estimate for PPV was reduced from -21 (IQR -34, -3) in Version 1.0 to 4 (IQR -3, 15) using Version 2.0. We found a median difference in specificity of 3 (IQR 1, 4.25) for Version 1.0 and 3 (IQR 1, 4) for Version 2.0. The median difference between the two versions of PheValuator and the gold standard for estimates of sensitivity was reduced from -39 (-51, -20) to -16 (-34, -6). CONCLUSION: PheValuator 2.0 produces estimates for the performance characteristics for phenotype algorithms that are significantly closer to estimates from traditional validation through chart review compared to version 1.0. With this tool in researcher's toolkits, methods, such as quantitative bias analysis, may now be used to improve the reliability and reproducibility of research studies using observational data.",PheValuator 2.0: Methodological improvements for the PheValuator approach to semi-automated phenotype algorithm evaluation.,"['Reproducibility of Results', '*Algorithms', 'Databases, Factual', '*Machine Learning', 'Phenotype']",,

An integral part of the OMOP CDM is the Standardized Vocabularies (henceforth referred to as the OMOP vocabulary), which enables organization and standardization of medical concepts across various clinical domains of the OMOP CDM. For concepts with the same meaning from different source vocabularies, one is designated as the standard concept, while the others are specified as non-standard or source concepts and mapped to the standard one. However, due to the heterogeneity of source vocabularies, there may exist mapping issues such as erroneous mappings and missing mappings in the OMOP vocabulary, which could affect the results of downstream analyses with RWD. In this paper, we focus on quality assurance of vaccine concept mappings in the OMOP vocabulary, which is necessary to accurately harness the power of RWD on vaccines. We introduce a semi-automated lexical approach to audit vaccine mappings in the OMOP vocabulary. We generated two types of vaccine-pairs: mapped and unmapped, where mapped vaccine-pairs are pairs of vaccine concepts with a ""Maps to"" relationship, while unmapped vaccine-pairs are those without a ""Maps to"" relationship. We represented each vaccine concept name as a set of words, and derived term-difference pairs (i.e., name differences) for mapped and unmapped vaccine-pairs. If the same term-difference pair can be obtained by both mapped and unmapped vaccine-pairs, then this is considered as a potential mapping inconsistency. Applying this approach to the vaccine mappings in OMOP, a total of 2087 potentially mapping inconsistencies were obtained. A randomly selected 200 samples were evaluated by domain experts to identify, validate, and categorize the inconsistencies. Experts identified 95 cases revealing valid mapping issues. The remaining 105 cases were found to be invalid due to the external and/or contextual information used in the mappings that were not reflected in the concept names of vaccines. This indicates that our semi-automated approach shows promise in identifying mapping inconsistencies among vaccine concepts in the OMOP vocabulary.",Towards quality improvement of vaccine concept mappings in the OMOP vocabulary with a semi-automated method.,"['Quality Improvement', '*Vaccines', '*Vocabulary', 'Vocabulary, Controlled']",,

However, some studies have shown that simple anonymisation procedures can sometimes be reverted using specific patients' characteristics.

Constructing clinical knowledge graphs (CKGs) against heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs) has been desired by the research and healthcare AI communities. From the standardization perspective, community-based standards such as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) are increasingly used to represent and standardize EHR data for clinical data analytics, however, the potential of such a standard on building CKG has not been well investigated. OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate methods and tools that expose the OMOP CDM-based clinical data repositories into virtual clinical KGs that are compliant with FHIR Resource Description Framework (RDF) specification. METHODS: We developed a system called FHIR-Ontop-OMOP to generate virtual clinical KGs from the OMOP relational databases. We leveraged an OMOP CDM-based Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) data repository to evaluate the FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system in terms of the faithfulness of data transformation and the conformance of the generated CKGs to the FHIR RDF specification. RESULTS: A beta version of the system has been released. A total of more than 100 data element mappings from 11 OMOP CDM clinical data, health system and vocabulary tables were implemented in the system, covering 11 FHIR resources. The generated virtual CKG from MIMIC-III contains 46,520 instances of FHIR Patient, 716,595 instances of Condition, 1,063,525 instances of Procedure, 24,934,751 instances of MedicationStatement, 365,181,104 instances of Observations, and 4,779,672 instances of CodeableConcept. Patient counts identified by five pairs of SQL (over the MIMIC database) and SPARQL (over the virtual CKG) queries were identical, ensuring the faithfulness of the data transformation. Generated CKG in RDF triples for 100 patients were fully conformant with the FHIR RDF specification. CONCLUSION: The FHIR-Ontop-OMOP system can expose OMOP database as a FHIR-compliant RDF graph.

Accurate and reliable identification of patients with DRE in observational data would enable large-scale, real-world comparative effectiveness research and improve access to specialized epilepsy care. In the present study, we aim to develop and compare the performance of computable phenotypes for DRE using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. METHODS: We randomly sampled 600 patients from our academic medical center's electronic health record (EHR)-derived OMOP database meeting previously validated criteria for epilepsy (January 2015-August 2021). Two reviewers manually classified patients as having DRE, drug-responsive epilepsy, undefined drug responsiveness, or no epilepsy as of the last EHR encounter in the study period based on consensus definitions. Demographic characteristics and codes for diagnoses, antiseizure medications (ASMs), and procedures were tested for association with DRE. Algorithms combining permutations of these factors were applied to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for DRE. The F1 score was used to compare overall performance. RESULTS: Among 412 patients with source record-confirmed epilepsy, 62 (15.0%) had DRE, 163 (39.6%) had drug-responsive epilepsy, 124 (30.0%) had undefined drug responsiveness, and 63 (15.3%) had insufficient records. The best performing phenotype for DRE in terms of the F1 score was the presence of >/=1 intractable epilepsy code and >/=2 unique non-gabapentinoid ASM exposures each with >/=90-day drug era (sensitivity = .661, specificity = .937, PPV = .594, NPV = .952, F1 score = .626). Several phenotypes achieved higher sensitivity at the expense of specificity and vice versa. SIGNIFICANCE: OMOP algorithms can identify DRE in EHR-derived data with varying tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity. These computable phenotypes can be applied across the largest international network of standardized clinical databases for further validation, reproducible observational research, and improving access to appropriate care.",Identification of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy in electronic medical record data using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model.,"['Humans', 'Electronic Health Records', '*Drug Resistant Epilepsy/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Databases, Factual', 'Data Collection', 'Algorithms', '*Epilepsy/diagnosis/drug therapy']",,

This study compared the clinical effectiveness of once-daily iGlarLixi versus a multiple-injection BI + rapid acting insulin (RAI) regimen in adults with T2D advancing from BI therapy in real-world clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic medical records from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) database were analysed retrospectively using propensity score matching to compare therapy advancement with iGlarLixi or BI + RAI in US adults >/=18 years with T2D on BI who had >/=1 valid glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) value at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up. The primary objective was non-inferiority of iGlarLixi to BI + RAI in HbA1c change from baseline to 6 months (margin 0.3%). RESULTS: Propensity score matching generated cohorts with balanced baseline characteristics (N = 814 in each group). HbA1c reduction from baseline to 6 months with iGlarLixi was non-inferior to BI + RAI [mean difference (95% confidence interval): 0.1 (-0.1, 0.2)%; one-sided p = .0032]. At 6 months, weight gain was significantly lower with iGlarLixi than with BI + RAI [-0.8 (-1.3, -0.2) kg; two-sided p = .0069]. Achievement of HbA1c <7% without hypoglycaemia and weight gain were similar between groups [odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.15 (0.81, 1.63); p = .4280]. Hypoglycaemia was low in both groups, probably because of underreporting. CONCLUSIONS: In real-world clinical practice, glycaemic outcomes 6 months after treatment advancement from BI are similar for people with T2D using iGlarLixi versus BI + RAI, with iGlarLixi leading to less weight gain.",iGlarLixi versus basal plus Rapid-Acting insulin in adults with type 2 diabetes advancing from basal insulin therapy: The SoliSimplify Real-World study.,"['Humans', '*Insulin, Short-Acting', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Insulin/adverse effects', 'Weight Gain']",,

Standardization is required for big data analysis when using ECG data generated by different interpretation algorithms. The common data model (CDM) is a standard schema designed to overcome heterogeneity between medical data. Diagnostic statements usually contain multiple CDM concepts and also include non-essential noise information, which should be removed during CDM conversion. Existing CDM conversion tools have several limitations, such as the requirement for manual validation, inability to extract multiple CDM concepts, and inadequate noise removal. OBJECTIVES: We aim to develop a fully automated text data conversion algorithm that overcomes limitations of existing tools and manual conversion. METHODS: We used interpretations printed by 12-lead resting ECG tests from three different vendors: GE Medical Systems, Philips Medical Systems, and Nihon Kohden. For automatic mapping, we first constructed an ontology-lexicon of ECG interpretations. After clinical coding, an optimized tool for converting ECG interpretation to CDM terminology is developed using term-based text processing. RESULTS: Using the ontology-lexicon, the cosine similarity-based algorithm and rule-based hierarchical algorithm showed comparable conversion accuracy (97.8 and 99.6%, respectively), while an integrated algorithm based on a heuristic approach, ECG2CDM, demonstrated superior performance (99.9%) for datasets from three major vendors. CONCLUSION: We developed a user-friendly software that runs the ECG2CDM algorithm that is easy to use even if the user is not familiar with CDM or medical terminology. We propose that automated algorithms can be helpful for further big data analysis with an integrated and standardized ECG dataset.",Conversion of Automated 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Interpretations to OMOP CDM Vocabulary.,"['Algorithms', 'Databases, Factual', '*Electrocardiography', 'Software', '*Vocabulary']",,

Methods: In this international cohort study, we deployed electronic health records from Spain (SIDIAP) and the United States (Department of Veterans Affairs, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, IQVIA OpenClaims, Optum DOD, Optum EHR). We assessed association between alpha-1 blocker use and risks of three COVID-19 outcomes-diagnosis, hospitalization, and hospitalization requiring intensive services-using a prevalent-user active-comparator design. We estimated hazard ratios using state-of-the-art techniques to minimize potential confounding, including large-scale propensity score matching/stratification and negative control calibration. We pooled database-specific estimates through random effects meta-analysis. Results: Our study overall included 2.6 and 0.46 million users of alpha-1 blockers and of alternative BPH medications.

The blueprint covers organisational, financial, conceptual, technical, analytical and research aspects, and discusses both the challenges and the lessons learned.

However, proper validation of computationally detected ADR signals is not possible due to the lack of a reference standard for positive and negative associations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a reference standard for ADR (RS-ADR) to streamline the systematic detection, assessment, and understanding of almost all drug-ADR associations suggested by RWD analyses. METHODS: We integrated well-known reference sets for drug-ADR pairs, including Side Effect Resource, Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership, and EU-ADR. We created a pharmacovigilance dictionary using controlled vocabularies and systematically annotated EHR data. Drug-ADR associations computed from MetaLAB and MetaNurse analyses of multicenter EHRs and extracted from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System were integrated as ""empirically determined"" positive and negative reference sets by means of cross-validation between institutions. RESULTS: The RS-ADR consisted of 1344 drugs, 4485 ADRs, and 6,027,840 drug-ADR pairs with positive and negative consensus votes as pharmacovigilance reference sets. After the curation of the initial version of RS-ADR, novel ADR signals such as ""famotidine-hepatic function abnormal"" were detected and reasonably validated by RS-ADR. Although the validation of the entire reference standard is challenging, especially with this initial version, the reference standard will improve as more RWD participate in the consensus voting with advanced pharmacovigilance dictionaries and analytic algorithms. One can check if a drug-ADR pair has been reported by our web-based search interface for RS-ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: RS-ADRs enriched with the pharmacovigilance dictionary, ADR knowledge, and real-world evidence from EHRs may streamline the systematic detection, evaluation, and causality assessment of computationally detected ADR signals.",A Data-Driven Reference Standard for Adverse Drug Reaction (RS-ADR) Signal Assessment: Development and Validation.,"['*Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis', 'Famotidine', 'Humans', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Reference Standards']",,

Differences in the CCI or frequency of individual comorbid conditions were assessed using standardized mean differences (SMD). Performance in predicting one-year mortality among hospitalized patients was measured based on the c-statistic of logistic regression models. RESULTS: For each database and calendar year combination, no significant differences in the CCI or frequency of individual comorbid conditions were observed between vocabularies (SMD </= 0.10). Specifically, the difference in CCI measured using the SNOMED CT vs. Quan coding algorithms was highest in MDCD in 2013 (3.75 vs. 3.6; SMD = 0.03) and lowest in DOD in 2018 (3.93 vs. 3.86; SMD = 0.02). Similarly, as indicated by the c-statistic, there was no evidence of a difference in the performance between coding algorithms in predicting one-year mortality (SNOMED CT vs. Quan coding algorithms, range: 0.725-0.789 vs. 0.723-0.787, respectively). A total of 700 of 5,348 (13.1%) ICD code mappings were inconsistent between coding algorithms. The most common cause of discrepant codes was multiple ICD codes mapping to a SNOMED CT code (n = 560) of which 213 were deemed clinically relevant thereby leading to information gain. CONCLUSION: The current study repurposed an important tool for conducting observational research to use the SNOMED CT standardized vocabulary.",Adaptation and validation of a coding algorithm for the Charlson Comorbidity Index in administrative claims data using the SNOMED CT standardized vocabulary.,"['Algorithms', 'Comorbidity', 'Humans', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', '*Vocabulary']",,

Mechanical ventilation data are complex and poorly standardized. This lack of data standardization is a major barrier to data sharing. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe current ventilator data in the electronic health record (EHR) and propose a framework for standardizing these data using a common data model (CDM) across multiple populations and sites. METHODS: We focused on a cohort of patients with LTMV dependence who were weaned from mechanical ventilation (MV). We extracted and described relevant EHR ventilation data. We identified the minimum necessary components, termed ""Clinical Ideas,"" to describe MV from time of initiation to liberation. We then utilized existing resources and partnered with informatics collaborators to develop a framework for incorporating Clinical Ideas into the PEDSnet CDM based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP). RESULTS: We identified 78 children with LTMV dependence who weaned from ventilator support. There were 25 unique device names and 28 unique ventilation mode names used in the cohort. We identified multiple Clinical Ideas necessary to describe ventilator support over time: device, interface, ventilation mode, settings, measurements, and duration of ventilation usage per day. We used Concepts from the SNOMED-CT vocabulary and integrated an existing ventilator mode taxonomy to create a framework for CDM and OMOP integration. CONCLUSION: The proposed framework standardizes mechanical ventilation terminology and may facilitate efficient data exchange in a multisite network.

International federated analyses are crucial for informing policy makers. Common data models (CDMs) are critical for enabling these studies to be performed efficiently. Our objective was to convert the UK Biobank, a study of 500 000 participants with rich genetic and phenotypic data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We converted UK Biobank data to OMOP CDM v. 5.3. We transformedparticipant research data on diseases collected at recruitment and electronic health records (EHRs) from primary care, hospitalizations, cancer registrations, and mortality from providers in England, Scotland, and Wales. We performed syntactic and semantic validations and compared comorbidities and risk factors between source and transformed data. RESULTS: We identified 502 505 participants (3086 with COVID-19) and transformed 690 fields (1 373 239 555 rows) to the OMOP CDM using 8 different controlled clinical terminologies and bespoke mappings. Specifically, we transformed self-reported noncancer illnesses 946 053 (83.91% of all source entries), cancers 37 802 (70.81%), medications 1 218 935 (88.25%), and prescriptions 864 788 (86.96%). In EHR, we transformed 13 028 182 (99.95%) hospital diagnoses, 6 465 399 (89.2%) procedures, 337 896 333 primary care diagnoses (CTV3, SNOMED-CT), 139 966 587 (98.74%) prescriptions (dm+d) and 77 127 (99.95%) deaths (ICD-10). We observed good concordance across demographic, risk factor, and comorbidity factors between source and transformed data. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the OMOP CDM can be successfully leveraged to harmonize complex large-scale biobanked studies combining rich multimodal phenotypic data. Our study uncovered several challenges when transforming data from questionnaires to the OMOP CDM which require further research.

Coronary artery computed tomography angiography (CCTA), which detects calcification in the coronary arteries, can be used to detect asymptomatic but serious vascular disease. It allows for noninvasive and quick testing despite involving radiation exposure. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of CCTA screening on CVD outcomes by using the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics' Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) data and the population-level estimation method. METHODS: Using electronic health record-based OMOP-CDM data, including health questionnaire responses, adults (aged 30-74 years) without a history of CVD were selected, and 5-year CVD outcomes were compared between patients undergoing CCTA (target group) and a comparison group via 1:1 propensity score matching. Participants were stratified into low-risk and high-risk groups based on the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score and Framingham risk score (FRS) for subgroup analyses. RESULTS: The 2-year and 5-year risk scores were compared as secondary outcomes between the two groups. In total, 8787 participants were included in both the target group and comparison group. No significant differences (calibration P=.37) were found between the hazard ratios of the groups at 5 years. The subgroup analysis also revealed no significant differences between the ASCVD risk scores and FRSs of the groups at 5 years (ASCVD risk score: P=.97; FRS: P=.85). However, the CCTA group showed a significantly lower increase in risk scores at 2 years (ASCVD risk score: P=.03; FRS: P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Although we could not confirm a significant difference in the preventive effects of CCTA screening for CVDs over a long period of 5 years, it may have a beneficial effect on risk score management over 2 years.",Coronary Artery Computed Tomography Angiography for Preventing Cardio-Cerebrovascular Disease: Observational Cohort Study Using the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics' Common Data Model.,,,

Such data in conjunction with clinical routine data are proven to be highly useful in deriving population-level and patient-level predictions, especially in the field of cancer precision medicine. However, data harmonization across multiple national and international clinical sites is an essential step for the assessment of events and outcomes associated with patients, which is currently not adequately addressed. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) is an internationally established research data repository introduced by the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) community to overcome this issue. To address the needs of cancer research, the genomic vocabulary extension was introduced in 2020 to support the standardization of subsequent data analysis. In this review, we evaluate the current potential of the OMOP CDM to be applicable in cancer prediction and how comprehensively the genomic vocabulary extension of the OMOP can serve current needs of AI-based predictions. For this, we systematically screened the literature for articles that use the OMOP CDM in predictive analyses in cancer and investigated the underlying predictive models/tools. Interestingly, we found 248 articles, of which most use the OMOP for harmonizing their data, but only 5 make use of predictive algorithms on OMOP-based data and fulfill our criteria. The studies present multicentric investigations, in which the OMOP played an essential role in discovering and optimizing machine learning (ML)-based models. Ultimately, the use of the OMOP CDM leads to standardized data-driven studies for multiple clinical sites and enables a more solid basis utilizing, e.g., ML models that can be reused and combined in early prediction, diagnosis, and improvement of personalized cancer care and biomarker discovery.",OMOP CDM Can Facilitate Data-Driven Studies for Cancer Prediction: A Systematic Review.,"['Biomarkers', 'Data Analysis', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', '*Medical Informatics', '*Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Precision Medicine']",,

Information is not always directly available in the source database and needs to be computed afterwards with raw data for defining an algorithm. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this article is to present a standardized description of the steps and transformations required during the feature extraction process when conducting retrospective observational studies. A secondary objective is to identify how the features could be stored in the schema of a data warehouse. METHODS: This study involved the following 3 main steps: (1) the collection of relevant study cases related to feature extraction and based on the automatic and secondary use of data; (2) the standardized description of raw data, steps, and transformations, which were common to the study cases; and (3) the identification of an appropriate table to store the features in the Observation Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). RESULTS: We interviewed 10 researchers from 3 French university hospitals and a national institution, who were involved in 8 retrospective and observational studies. Based on these studies, 2 states (track and feature) and 2 transformations (track definition and track aggregation) emerged. ""Track"" is a time-dependent signal or period of interest, defined by a statistical unit, a value, and 2 milestones (a start event and an end event). ""Feature"" is time-independent high-level information with dimensionality identical to the statistical unit of the study, defined by a label and a value. The time dimension has become implicit in the value or name of the variable. We propose the 2 tables ""TRACK"" and ""FEATURE"" to store variables obtained in feature extraction and extend the OMOP CDM. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a standardized description of the feature extraction process. The process combined the 2 steps of track definition and track aggregation. By dividing the feature extraction into these 2 steps, difficulty was managed during track definition. The standardization of tracks requires great expertise with regard to the data, but allows the application of an infinite number of complex transformations. On the contrary, track aggregation is a very simple operation with a finite number of possibilities. A complete description of these steps could enhance the reproducibility of retrospective studies.",Standardized Description of the Feature Extraction Process to Transform Raw Data Into Meaningful Information for Enhancing Data Reuse: Consensus Study.,,,

We estimated SLP compliance (SLPC) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (CDM). METHODS: Patients were classified into eight groups: pre- and post-hematology disease (A and B), pre- and post-solid organ transplantation (C and D), solid cancer (E), immunodeficiency (F), anticancer therapy (G), and cardiovascular surgery (H). We examined the red blood cell (RBC) transfusion history from three hospital datasets comprising approximately three million patients over 20 years using CDM-based analysis. SLPC was calculated as the percentage of patients who received only leukoreduced RBCs in total patients transfused RBCs. RESULTS: In total, 166,641 patients from three hospitals were enrolled in this study. From 2001 to 2021, SLPC in all groups, except H, tended to increase, although there were differences among the hospitals. Based on the most recent values (2017-2021), the SLPC in groups A, B, D, and G was maintained at >/=75% until 1,095 days before or after diagnosis or treatment. Groups E, F, and H had < 50% SLPC one day after diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CDM analysis supports the review of large datasets for SLPC evaluation. Although SLPC tended to improve in most patient groups, additional education and monitoring are needed for groups that continue to show low SLPC.",Common Data Model-based Analysis of Selective Leukoreduction Protocol Compliance at Three Hospitals.,"['Humans', '*Guideline Adherence', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion/methods', 'Erythrocytes', 'Hospitals']",,

This paper contributes a method for automated ontology-based categorization of clinical studies by their conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our method first maps text entries in ClinicalTrials.gov's Condition field to standard condition concepts in the OMOP Common Data Model by using SNOMED CT as a reference ontology and using Usagi for concept normalization, followed by hierarchical traversal of the SNOMED ontology for concept expansion, ontology-driven condition categorization, and visualization. We compared the accuracy of this method to that of the MeSH-based method. RESULTS: We reviewed the 4,506 studies on Vivli.org categorized by our method. Condition terms of 4,501 (99.89%) studies were successfully mapped to SNOMED CT concepts, and with a minimum concept mapping score threshold, 4,428 (98.27%) studies were categorized into 31 predefined categories. When validating with manual categorization results on a random sample of 300 studies, our method achieved an estimated categorization accuracy of 95.7%, while the MeSH-based method had an accuracy of 85.0%. CONCLUSION: We showed that categorizing clinical studies using their Condition terms with referencing to SNOMED CT achieved a better accuracy and coverage than using MeSH terms.

One of the key challenges for collaborative research is a lack of interoperability among various heterogeneous data sources. Interoperability, standardization and mapping of datasets are necessary for data analysis and applications in advanced algorithms such as developing personalized risk prediction modeling. RESULTS: To ensure the interoperability and compatibility among COVID-19 datasets, we present here a common data model (CDM) which has been built from 11 different COVID-19 datasets from various geographical locations. The current version of the CDM holds 4639 data variables related to COVID-19 such as basic patient information (age, biological sex and diagnosis) as well as disease-specific data variables, for example, Anosmia and Dyspnea. Each of the data variables in the data model is associated with specific data types, variable mappings, value ranges, data units and data encodings that could be used for standardizing any dataset. Moreover, the compatibility with established data standards like OMOP and FHIR makes the CDM a well-designed CDM for COVID-19 data interoperability.

However, this task is difficult when it comes to Electronic Health Records (EHR). In combating the COVID-19 pandemic for maternal health, we sought to develop and validate a clinical information extraction algorithm to detect the time of clinical events relative to gestational weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used EHR from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), in which the EHR are normalized by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). We performed EHR phenotyping, resulting in 270,897 pregnant women (June 1st, 2018 to May 31st, 2021). We developed a rule-based algorithm and performed a multi-level evaluation to test content validity and clinical validity, and extreme length of gestation (<150 or >300). RESULTS: The algorithm identified 296,194 pregnancies (16,659 COVID-19, 174,744 without COVID-19) in 270,897 pregnant women. For inferring gestational age, 95% cases (n = 40) have moderate-high accuracy (Cohen's Kappa = 0.62); 100% cases (n = 40) have moderate-high granularity of temporal information (Cohen's Kappa = 1). For inferring delivery dates, the accuracy is 100% (Cohen's Kappa = 1). The accuracy of gestational age detection for the extreme length of gestation is 93.3% (Cohen's Kappa = 1). Mothers with COVID-19 showed higher prevalence in obesity or overweight (35.1% vs. 29.5%), diabetes (17.8% vs. 17.0%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.2% vs. 0.1%), respiratory distress syndrome or acute respiratory failure (1.8% vs. 0.2%). DISCUSSION: We explored the characteristics of pregnant women by different gestational weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection with our algorithm. TED-PC is the first to infer the exact gestational week linked with every clinical event from EHR and detect the timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women. CONCLUSION: The algorithm shows excellent clinical validity in inferring gestational age and delivery dates, which supports multiple EHR cohorts on N3C studying the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy.",Temporal Events Detector for Pregnancy Care (TED-PC): A rule-based algorithm to infer gestational age and delivery date from electronic health records of pregnant women with and without COVID-19.,"['Female', 'Pregnancy', 'Humans', '*COVID-19/epidemiology', 'Pandemics', 'Pregnant Women', 'Gestational Age', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Electronic Health Records', '*Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Algorithms', '*Premature Birth/epidemiology']",,

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that, in 2019, approximately 229 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide, with 94% occurring in the WHO's African region (WHO 2020). Of these malaria cases, an estimated 409,000 deaths occurred globally, with 67% occurring in children under five years of age (WHO 2020). Malaria also negatively impacts the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period (WHO 2020). Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP), an antifolate antimalarial, has been widely used across sub-Saharan Africa as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria since it was first introduced in Malawi in 1993 (Filler 2006). Due to increasing resistance to SP, in 2000 the WHO recommended that one of several artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) be used instead of SP for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Global Partnership to Roll Back Malaria 2001). However, despite these recommendations, SP continues to be advised for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi), whether the person has malaria or not (WHO 2013). Description of the intervention Folate (vitamin B9) includes both naturally occurring folates and folic acid, the fully oxidized monoglutamic form of the vitamin, used in dietary supplements and fortified food. Folate deficiency (e.g. red blood cell (RBC) folate concentrations of less than 305 nanomoles per litre (nmol/L); serum or plasma concentrations of less than 7 nmol/L) is common in many parts of the world and often presents as megaloblastic anaemia, resulting from inadequate intake, increased requirements, reduced absorption, or abnormal metabolism of folate (Bailey 2015; WHO 2015a). Pregnant women have greater folate requirements; inadequate folate intake (evidenced by RBC folate concentrations of less than 400 nanograms per millilitre (ng/mL), or 906 nmol/L) prior to and during the first month of pregnancy increases the risk of neural tube defects, preterm delivery, low birthweight, and fetal growth restriction (Bourassa 2019). The WHO recommends that all women who are trying to conceive consume 400 micrograms (microg) of folic acid daily from the time they begin trying to conceive through to 12 weeks of gestation (WHO 2017). In 2015, the WHO added the dosage of 0.4 mg of folic acid to the essential drug list (WHO 2015c). Alongside daily oral iron (30 mg to 60 mg elemental iron), folic acid supplementation is recommended for pregnant women to prevent neural tube defects, maternal anaemia, puerperal sepsis, low birthweight, and preterm birth in settings where anaemia in pregnant women is a severe public health problem (i.e. where at least 40% of pregnant women have a blood haemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 110 g/L). How the intervention might work Potential interactions between folate status and malaria infection The malaria parasite requires folate for survival and growth; this has led to the hypothesis that folate status may influence malaria risk and severity. In rhesus monkeys, folate deficiency has been found to be protective against Plasmodium cynomolgi malaria infection, compared to folate-replete animals (Metz 2007). Alternatively, malaria may induce or exacerbate folate deficiency due to increased folate utilization from haemolysis and fever. Further, folate status measured via RBC folate is not an appropriate biomarker of folate status in malaria-infected individuals since RBC folate values in these individuals are indicative of both the person's stores and the parasite's folate synthesis. A study in Nigeria found that children with malaria infection had significantly higher RBC folate concentrations compared to children without malaria infection, but plasma folate levels were similar (Bradley-Moore 1985). Why it is important to do this review The malaria parasite needs folate for survival and growth in humans. For individuals, adequate folate levels are critical for health and well-being, and for the prevention of anaemia and neural tube defects. Many countries rely on folic acid supplementation to ensure adequate folate status in at-risk populations. Different formulations for folic acid supplements are available in many international settings, with dosages ranging from 400 microg to 5 mg. Evaluating folic acid dosage levels used in supplementation efforts may increase public health understanding of its potential impacts on malaria risk and severity and on treatment failures. Examining folic acid interactions with antifolate antimalarial medications and with malaria disease progression may help countries in malaria-endemic areas determine what are the most appropriate lower dose folic acid formulations for at-risk populations. The WHO has highlighted the limited evidence available and has indicated the need for further research on biomarkers of folate status, particularly interactions between RBC folate concentrations and tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and antifolate antimalarial drugs (WHO 2015b). An earlier Cochrane Review assessed the effects and safety of iron supplementation, with or without folic acid, in children living in hyperendemic or holoendemic malaria areas; it demonstrated that iron supplementation did not increase the risk of malaria, as indicated by fever and the presence of parasites in the blood (Neuberger 2016). Further, this review stated that folic acid may interfere with the efficacy of SP; however, the efficacy and safety of folic acid supplementation on these outcomes has not been established. This review will provide evidence on the effectiveness of daily folic acid supplementation in healthy and malaria-infected individuals living in malaria-endemic areas. Additionally, it will contribute to achieving both the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 (WHO 2015d), and United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (to ensure healthy lives and to promote well-being for all of all ages) (United Nations 2021), and evaluating whether the potential effects of folic acid supplementation, at different doses (e.g. 0.4 mg, 1 mg, 5 mg daily), interferes with the effect of drugs used for prevention or treatment of malaria. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of folic acid supplementation, at various doses, on malaria susceptibility (risk of infection) and severity among people living in areas with various degrees of malaria endemicity. We will examine the interaction between folic acid supplements and antifolate antimalarial drugs. Specifically, we will aim to answer the following. Among uninfected people living in malaria endemic areas, who are taking or not taking antifolate antimalarials for malaria prophylaxis, does taking a folic acid-containing supplement increase susceptibility to or severity of malaria infection? Among people with malaria infection who are being treated with antifolate antimalarials, does folic acid supplementation increase the risk of treatment failure? METHODS: Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies Inclusion criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) Quasi-RCTs with randomization at the individual or cluster level conducted in malaria-endemic areas (areas with ongoing, local malaria transmission, including areas approaching elimination, as listed in the World Malaria Report 2020) (WHO 2020) Exclusion criteria Ecological studies Observational studies In vivo/in vitro studies Economic studies Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses (relevant systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses will be excluded but flagged for grey literature screening) Types of participants Inclusion criteria Individuals of any age or gender, living in a malaria endemic area, who are taking antifolate antimalarial medications (including but not limited to sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP), pyrimethamine-dapsone, pyrimethamine, chloroquine and proguanil, cotrimoxazole) for the prevention or treatment of malaria (studies will be included if more than 70% of the participants live in malaria-endemic regions) Studies assessing participants with or without anaemia and with or without malaria parasitaemia at baseline will be included Exclusion criteria Individuals not taking antifolate antimalarial medications for prevention or treatment of malaria Individuals living in non-malaria endemic areas Types of interventions Inclusion criteria Folic acid supplementation Form: in tablet, capsule, dispersible tablet at any dose, during administration, or periodically Timing: during, before, or after (within a period of four to six weeks) administration of antifolate antimalarials Iron-folic acid supplementation Folic acid supplementation in combination with co-interventions that are identical between the intervention and control groups.

Secondary outcomes Duration of parasitaemia Parasite density Haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations (g/L) Anaemia: severe anaemia (defined as Hb less than 70 g/L in pregnant women and children aged six to 59 months; and Hb less than 80 g/L in other populations); moderate anaemia (defined as Hb less than 100 g/L in pregnant women and children aged six to 59 months; and less than 110 g/L in others) Death from any cause Among pregnant women: stillbirth (at less than 28 weeks gestation); low birthweight (less than 2500 g); active placental malaria (defined as Plasmodium detected in placental blood by smear or PCR, or by Plasmodium detected on impression smear or placental histology). Search methods for identification of studies A search will be conducted to identify completed and ongoing studies, without date or language restrictions. Electronic searches A search strategy will be designed to include the appropriate subject headings and text word terms related to each intervention of interest and study design of interest (see Appendix 1). Searches will be broken down by these two criteria (intervention of interest and study design of interest) to allow for ease of prioritization, if necessary. The study design filters recommended by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), and those designed by Cochrane for identifying clinical trials for MEDLINE and Embase, will be used (SIGN 2020). There will be no date or language restrictions. Non-English articles identified for inclusion will be translated into English. If translations are not possible, advice will be requested from the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group and the record will be stored in the ""Awaiting assessment"" section of the review until a translation is available. The following electronic databases will be searched for primary studies. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Embase. MEDLINE. Scopus. Web of Science (both the Social Science Citation Index and the Science Citation Index). We will conduct manual searches of ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Evaluation and Research Database (ERD), in order to identify relevant ongoing or planned trials, abstracts, and full-text reports of evaluations, studies, and surveys related to programmes on folic acid supplementation in malaria-endemic areas. Additionally, manual searches of grey literature to identify RCTs that have not yet been published but are potentially eligible for inclusion will be conducted in the following sources. Global Index Medicus (GIM). African Index Medicus (AIM). Index Medicus for the Eastern Mediterranean Region (IMEMR). Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Western Pacific Region Index Medicus (WPRO). Index Medicus for the South-East Asian Region (IMSEAR).

Native Health Database (nativehealthdatabase.net/). Scielo (www.scielo.br/). Searching other resources Handsearches of the five journals with the highest number of included studies in the last 12 months will be conducted to capture any relevant articles that may not have been indexed in the databases at the time of the search. We will contact the authors of included studies and will check reference lists of included papers for the identification of additional records. For assistance in identifying ongoing or unpublished studies, we will contact the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO) and the Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria (DPDM) of the CDC, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), Nutrition International (NI), Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), and Hellen Keller International (HKI). Data collection and analysis Selection of studies Two review authors will independently screen the titles and abstracts of articles retrieved by each search to assess eligibility, as determined by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies deemed eligible for inclusion by both review authors in the abstract screening phase will advance to the full-text screening phase, and full-text copies of all eligible papers will be retrieved. If full articles cannot be obtained, we will attempt to contact the authors to obtain further details of the studies. If such information is not obtained, we will classify the study as ""awaiting assessment"" until further information is published or made available to us. The same two review authors will independently assess the eligibility of full-text articles for inclusion in the systematic review. If any discrepancies occur between the studies selected by the two review authors, a third review author will provide arbitration. Each trial will be scrutinized to identify multiple publications from the same data set, and the justification for excluded trials will be documented. A PRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process will be presented to provide information on the number of records identified in the literature searches, the number of studies included and excluded, and the reasons for exclusion (Moher 2009). The list of excluded studies, along with their reasons for exclusion at the full-text screening phase, will also be created. Data extraction and management Two review authors will independently extract data for the final list of included studies using a standardized data specification form. Discrepancies observed between the data extracted by the two authors will be resolved by involving a third review author and reaching a consensus. Information will be extracted on study design components, baseline participant characteristics, intervention characteristics, and outcomes. For individually randomized trials, we will record the number of participants experiencing the event and the number analyzed in each treatment group or the effect estimate reported (e.g. risk ratio (RR)) for dichotomous outcome measures. For count data, we will record the number of events and the number of person-months of follow-up in each group. If the number of person-months is not reported, the product of the duration of follow-up and the number of children evaluated will be used to estimate this figure. We will calculate the rate ratio and standard error (SE) for each study. Zero events will be replaced by 0.5. We will extract both adjusted and unadjusted covariate incidence rate ratios if they are reported in the original studies. For continuous data, we will extract means (arithmetic or geometric) and a measure of variance (standard deviation (SD), SE, or confidence interval (CI)), percentage or mean change from baseline, and the numbers analyzed in each group. SDs will be computed from SEs or 95% CIs, assuming a normal distribution of the values. Haemoglobin values in g/dL will be calculated by multiplying haematocrit or packed cell volume values by 0.34, and studies reporting haemoglobin values in g/dL will be converted to g/L. In cluster-randomized trials, we will record the unit of randomization (e.g. household, compound, sector, or village), the number of clusters in the trial, and the average cluster size. The statistical methods used to analyze the trials will be documented, along with details describing whether these methods adjusted for clustering or other covariates. We plan to extract estimates of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for each outcome. Where results are adjusted for clustering, we will extract the treatment effect estimate and the SD or CI. If the results are not adjusted for clustering, we will extract the data reported. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two review authors (KSC, LFY) will independently assess the risk of bias for each included trial using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias 2' tool (RoB 2) for randomized studies (Sterne 2019). Judgements about the risk of bias of included studies will be made according to the recommendations outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2021). Disagreements will be resolved by discussion, or by involving a third review author. The interest of our review will be to assess the effect of assignment to the interventions at baseline. We will evaluate each primary outcome using the RoB2 tool. The five domains of the Cochrane RoB2 tool include the following. Bias arising from the randomization process. Bias due to deviations from intended interventions. Bias due to missing outcome data. Bias in measurement of the outcome. Bias in selection of the reported result. Each domain of the RoB2 tool comprises the following. A series of 'signalling' questions. A judgement about the risk of bias for the domain, facilitated by an algorithm that maps responses to the signalling questions to a proposed judgement. Free-text boxes to justify responses to the signalling questions and 'Risk of bias' judgements. An option to predict (and explain) the likely direction of bias. Responses to signalling questions elicit information relevant to an assessment of the risk of bias. These response options are as follows. Yes (may indicate either low or high risk of bias, depending on the most natural way to ask the question). Probably yes. Probably no. No. No information (may indicate no evidence of that problem or an absence of information leading to concerns about there being a problem). Based on the answer to the signalling question, a 'Risk of bias' judgement is assigned to each domain. These judgements include one of the following. High risk of bias Low risk of bias Some concerns To generate the risk of bias judgement for each domain in the randomized studies, we will use the Excel template, available at www.riskofbias.info/welcome/rob-2-0-tool/current-version-of-rob-2. This file will be stored on a scientific data website, available to readers. Risk of bias in cluster randomized controlled trials For the cluster randomized trials, we will be using the RoB2 tool to analyze the five standard domains listed above along with Domain 1b (bias arising from the timing of identification or recruitment of participants) and its related signalling questions. To generate the risk of bias judgement for each domain in the cluster RCTs, we will use the Excel template available at https://sites.google.com/site/riskofbiastool/welcome/rob-2-0-tool/rob-2-for-cluster-randomized-trials. This file will be stored on a scientific data website, available to readers. Risk of bias in cross-over randomized controlled trials For cross-over randomized trials, we will be using the RoB2 tool to analyze the five standard domains listed above along with Domain 2 (bias due to deviations from intended interventions), and Domain 3 (bias due to missing outcome data), and their respective signalling questions. To generate the risk of bias judgement for each domain in the cross-over RCTs, we will use the Excel template, available at https://sites.google.com/site/riskofbiastool/welcome/rob-2-0-tool/rob-2-for-crossover-trials, for each risk of bias judgement of cross-over randomized studies. This file will be stored on a scientific data website, available to readers. Overall risk of bias The overall 'Risk of bias' judgement for each specific trial being assessed will be based on each domain-level judgement. The overall judgements include the following. Low risk of bias (the trial is judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains). Some concerns (the trial is judged to raise some concerns in at least one domain but is not judged to be at high risk of bias for any domain). High risk of bias (the trial is judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain, or is judged to have some concerns for multiple domains in a way that substantially lowers confidence in the result). The 'risk of bias' assessments will inform our GRADE evaluations of the certainty of evidence for our primary outcomes presented in the 'Summary of findings' tables and will also be used to inform the sensitivity analyses; (see Sensitivity analysis). If there is insufficient information in study reports to enable an assessment of the risk of bias, studies will be classified as ""awaiting assessment"" until further information is published or made available to us. Measures of treatment effect Dichotomous data For dichotomous data, we will present proportions and, for two-group comparisons, results as average RR or odds ratio (OR) with 95% CIs. Ordered categorical data Continuous data We will report results for continuous outcomes as the mean difference (MD) with 95% CIs, if outcomes are measured in the same way between trials. Where some studies have reported endpoint data and others have reported change-from-baseline data (with errors), we will combine these in the meta-analysis, if the outcomes were reported using the same scale. We will use the standardized mean difference (SMD), with 95% CIs, to combine trials that measured the same outcome but used different methods. If we do not find three or more studies for a pooled analysis, we will summarize the results in a narrative form. Unit of analysis issues Cluster-randomized trials We plan to combine results from both cluster-randomized and individually randomized studies, providing there is little heterogeneity between the studies. If the authors of cluster-randomized trials conducted their analyses at a different level from that of allocation, and they have not appropriately accounted for the cluster design in their analyses, we will calculate the trials' effective sample sizes to account for the effect of clustering in data. When one or more cluster-RCT reports RRs adjusted for clustering, we will compute cluster-adjusted SEs for the other trials. When none of the cluster-RCTs provide cluster-adjusted RRs, we will adjust the sample size for clustering. We will divide, by the estimated design effects (DE), the number of events and number evaluated for dichotomous outcomes and the number evaluated for continuous outcomes, where DE = 1 + ((average cluster size 1) * ICC). The derivation of the estimated ICCs and DEs will be reported. We will utilize the intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC), derived from the trial (if available), or from another source (e.g., using the ICCs derived from other, similar trials) and then calculate the design effect with the formula provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2021). If this approach is used, we will report it and undertake sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of variations in ICC. Studies with more than two treatment groups If we identify studies with more than two intervention groups (multi-arm studies), where possible we will combine groups to create a single pair-wise comparison or use the methods set out in the Cochrane Handbook to avoid double counting study participants (Higgins 2021). For the subgroup analyses, when the control group was shared by two or more study arms, we will divide the control group (events and total population) over the number of relevant subgroups to avoid double counting the participants. Trials with several study arms can be included more than once for different comparisons. Cross-over trials From cross-over trials, we will consider the first period of measurement only and will analyze the results together with parallel-group studies. Multiple outcome events In several outcomes, a participant might experience more than one outcome event during the trial period. For all outcomes, we will extract the number of participants with at least one event. Dealing with missing data We will contact the trial authors if the available data are unclear, missing, or reported in a format that is different from the format needed. We aim to perform a 'per protocol' or 'as observed' analysis; otherwise, we will perform a complete case analysis. This means that for treatment failure, we will base the analyses on the participants who received treatment and the number of participants for which there was an inability to clear malarial parasitaemia or prevent recrudescence after administration of an antimalarial medicine reported in the studies. Assessment of heterogeneity Heterogeneity in the results of the trials will be assessed by visually examining the forest plot to detect non-overlapping CIs, using the Chi2 test of heterogeneity (where a P value of less than 0.1 indicates statistical significance) and the I2 statistic of inconsistency (with a value of greater than 50% denoting moderate levels of heterogeneity). When statistical heterogeneity is present, we will investigate the reasons for it, using subgroup analysis. Assessment of reporting biases We will construct a funnel plot to assess the effect of small studies for the main outcome (when including more than 10 trials). Data synthesis The primary analysis will include all eligible studies that provide data regardless of the overall risk of bias as assessed by the RoB2 tool. Analyses will be conducted using Review Manager 5.4 (Review Manager 2020). Cluster-RCTs will be included in the main analysis after adjustment for clustering (see the previous section on cluster-RCTs). The meta-analysis will be performed using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model or the generic inverse variance method (when adjustment for clustering is performed by adjusting SEs), as appropriate. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity The overall risk of bias will not be used as the basis in conducting our subgroup analyses. However, where data are available, we plan to conduct the following subgroup analyses, independent of heterogeneity. Dose of folic acid supplementation: higher doses (4 mg or more, daily) versus lower doses (less than 4 mg, daily). Moderate-severe anaemia at baseline (mean haemoglobin of participants in a trial at baseline below 100 g/L for pregnant women and children aged six to 59 months, and below 110 g/L for other populations) versus normal at baseline (mean haemoglobin above 100 g/L for pregnant women and children aged six to 59 months, and above 110 g/L for other populations). Antimalarial drug resistance to parasite: known resistance versus no resistance versus unknown/mixed/unreported parasite resistance. Folate status at baseline: Deficient (e.g. RBC folate concentration of less than 305 nmol/L, or serum folate concentration of less than 7nmol/L) and Insufficient (e.g. RBC folate concentration from 305 to less than 906 nmol/L, or serum folate concentration from 7 to less than 25 nmol/L) versus Sufficient (e.g. RBC folate concentration above 906 nmol/L, or serum folate concentration above 25 nmol/L). Presence of anaemia at baseline: yes versus no. Mandatory fortification status: yes, versus no (voluntary or none). We will only use the primary outcomes in any subgroup analyses, and we will limit subgroup analyses to those outcomes for which three or more trials contributed data. Comparisons between subgroups will be performed using Review Manager 5.4 (Review Manager 2020). Sensitivity analysis We will perform a sensitivity analysis, using the risk of bias as a variable to explore the robustness of the findings in our primary outcomes. We will verify the behaviour of our estimators by adding and removing studies with a high risk of bias overall from the analysis. That is, studies with a low risk of bias versus studies with a high risk of bias. Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence For the assessment across studies, we will use the GRADE approach, as outlined in (Schunemann 2021). We will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations based on RoB2 judgements, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the primary outcomes. The GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GRADEpro) will be used to import data from Review Manager 5.4 (Review Manager 2020) to create 'Summary of Findings' tables. The primary outcomes for the main comparison will be listed with estimates of relative effects, along with the number of participants and studies contributing data for those outcomes. These tables will provide outcome-specific information concerning the overall certainty of evidence from studies included in the comparison, the magnitude of the effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on the outcomes we considered. We will include only primary outcomes in the summary of findings tables. For each individual outcome, two review authors (KSC, LFY) will independently assess the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach (Balshem 2011). For assessments of the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome that includes pooled data from included trials, we will downgrade the evidence from 'high certainty' by one level for serious (or by two for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates, or potential publication bias).",Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.,"['Child', 'Infant', 'Pregnancy', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Child, Preschool', '*Antimalarials/therapeutic use', 'Sulfadoxine/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimethamine/therapeutic use', '*Folic Acid Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Birth Weight', 'Parasitemia/drug therapy', 'Vitamins', 'Folic Acid/therapeutic use', '*Anemia/drug therapy', '*Neural Tube Defects', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Iron/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",,

United Kingdom as a by-product of clinical care and public health provision, as well as numerous bespoke and repurposed research endeavors. Analysis of these data has underpinned the United Kingdom's response to the pandemic, and informed public health policies and clinical guidelines. However, these data are held by different organizations, and this fragmented landscape has presented challenges for public health agencies and researchers as they struggle to find relevant data to access and interrogate the data they need to inform the pandemic response at pace. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to transform UK COVID-19 diagnostic data sets to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). METHODS: A federated infrastructure model (COVID - Curated and Open Analysis and Research Platform [CO-CONNECT]) was rapidly built to enable the automated and reproducible mapping of health data partners' pseudonymized data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model without the need for any data to leave the data controllers' secure environments, and to support federated cohort discovery queries and meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 56 data sets from 19 organizations are being connected to the federated network. The data include research cohorts and COVID-19 data collected through routine health care provision linked to longitudinal health care records and demographics. The infrastructure is live, supporting aggregate-level querying of data across the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS: CO-CONNECT was developed by a multidisciplinary team. It enables rapid COVID-19 data discovery and instantaneous meta-analysis across data sources, and it is researching streamlined data extraction for use in a Trusted Research Environment for research and public health analysis. CO-CONNECT has the potential to make UK health data more interconnected and better able to answer national-level research questions while maintaining patient confidentiality and local governance procedures.",A Hybrid Architecture (CO-CONNECT) to Facilitate Rapid Discovery and Access to Data Across the United Kingdom in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development Study.,"['Humans', '*COVID-19/epidemiology', 'Pandemics', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,

This study aimed to explore the psychiatric outpatient attendance of LLD patients at a psychiatric hospital in China, with a subgroup analysis, such as with or without anxiety, gender differences. METHODS: This retrospective study examined outpatients with LLD from January 2013 to August 2019 using data in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) in Beijing Anding Hospital. Age, sex, number of visits, use of drugs and comorbid conditions were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: In a sample of 47,334 unipolar depression patients, 31,854 (67.30%) were women, and 15,480 (32.70%) were men. The main comorbidities of LDD are generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (83.62%) and insomnia (74.52%).Among patients with unipolar depression, of which benzodiazepines accounted for the largest proportion (77.77%), Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) accounted for 59.00%, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSAs) accounted for 36.20%. The average cost of each visit was approximately 646.27 yuan, and the cost of each visit was primarily attributed to Western medicine (22.97%) and Chinese herbal medicine (19.38%). For the cost of outpatient visits, depression comorbid anxiety group had a higher average cost than the non-anxiety group (p < 0.05). There are gender differences in outpatient costs, men spend more than women, for western medicine, men spend more than women, for Chinese herbal medicine, women spend more than men (all p < 0.05). The utilization rate of SSRIs and benzodiazepines in female patients is significantly higher than that in male patients (p < 0.05).

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most frequently prescribed treatment, but they have been shown to be associated with dementia. The data are inconsistent, however. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between PPIs use and Alzheimer's disease (AD) or all-cause dementia in six observational Korean databases using a Common Data Model (CDM) and to perform a distributed network analysis. METHODS: Subjects aged over 18 years between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2020. Among 7,293,565 subjects from 6 cohorts, 41,670 patients met the eligibility criteria. A total of 2206 patients who were included in both cohorts or with a history of dementia were excluded. After propensity matching, 5699 propensity-matched pairs between the PPIs and histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H(2)RA) users were included in this study. The primary outcome was the incidence of AD at least 365 days after drug exposure. The secondary outcome was the incidence of all-cause dementia at least 365 days after drug exposure. RESULTS: In the 1:1 propensity score matching, the risk of AD or all-cause dementia was not significantly different between the PPIs and H(2)RA groups in all six databases. In the distributed network analysis, the long-term PPI users (⩾365 days) were unassociated with AD [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.68-1.23; I (2) = 0%] and all-cause dementia (HR =1.04, 95% CI = 0.82-1.31; I (2) = 0%) compared with H(2)RA users. CONCLUSION: In the distributed network analysis of six Korean hospital databases using Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM data, the long-term use of PPI was not associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of AD or all-cause dementia. Therefore, we suggest that physicians should not avoid these medications because of concern about dementia risk.",Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitor on Alzheimer's disease: a real-world distributed network analysis of six observational Korean databases using a Common Data Model.,,,

To achieve this goal across the European Union, the EMA set up the DARWIN EU project based on OMOP CDM established by the OHDSI community. The harmonization of heterogeneous local health data in OMOP CDM is an essential step to participate in such networks. Using the widespread communication standard HL7 FHIR can reduce the complexity of the transformation process to OMOP CDM. Enabling German university hospitals to participate in such networks requires an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL)-process that satisfies the following criteria: 1) transforming German patient data from FHIR to OMOP CDM, 2) processing huge amount of data at once and 3) flexibility to cope with changes in FHIR profiles. METHOD: A mapping of German patient data from FHIR to OMOP CDM was accomplished, validated by an interdisciplinary team and checked through the OHDSI Data Quality Dashboard (DQD). To satisfy criteria 2-3, we decided to use SpringBatch-Framework according to its chunk-oriented design and reusable functions for processing large amounts of data. RESULTS: We have successfully developed an ETL-process that fulfills the defined criteria of transforming German patient data from FHIR into OMOP CDM. To measure the validity of the mapping conformance and performance of the ETL-process, it was tested with 392,022 FHIR resources. The ETL execution lasted approximately-one minute and the DQD result shows 99% conformance in OMOP CDM. CONCLUSIONS: Our ETL-process has been successfully tested and integrated at 10 German university hospitals. The data harmonization utilizing international recognized standards like FHIR and OMOP fosters their ability to participate in international observational studies. Additionally, the ETL process can help to prepare more German hospitals with their data harmonization journey based on existing standards.",An ETL-process design for data harmonization to participate in international research with German real-world data based on FHIR and OMOP CDM.,"['Humans', 'European Union', '*Data Mining', '*International Cooperation']",,

DaVINCI utilizes the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to map DoD and VA-specific health care codes to a standardized terminology. Although OMOP CDM provides a standardized longitudinal view of health care concepts, it fails in capturing multiple and changing relationships beneficiaries have with DoD and VA as it has a static (vs. yearly) person characteristic table. Furthermore, DoD and VA utilize different policies and terminology to identify their respective beneficiaries, which makes it difficult to track patients longitudinally. The primary purpose of this report is to provide a methodology for categorizing beneficiaries and creating continuous longitudinal patient records to maximize the use of the joint DoD and VA data in DaVINCI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For calendar year 2000-2020, we combined DoD and VA OMOP CDM and source databases to uniquely categorize beneficiaries into the following hierarchical groups: Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve Service Members (ADSMs); Separatees; Retirees; Veterans; and Deceased. Once the cohorts were identified, we examined calendar year 2020 health care utilization data using the OMOP VISIT_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, MEASUREMENT, and PROCEDURE tables. We also used the Defense Enrollment and Eligibility Reporting System source table to derive enrollment periods for DoD beneficiaries. As VA does not have enrollment plans, we utilized the VA's priority groups (1-5) in the SPATIENT source table to crosswalk the DoD's enrollment concept to the VA. We then assessed lengths of continuous enrollments in DoD and VA and the impact of appending the longitudinal records together. RESULTS: The majority of the ADSMs utilized the DoD system, but about 60,557 (3%) were seen in the VA for varied types of care. The market share of care provided to ADSMs by the VA varied by specialty and location. For Retirees, the split between DoD (1,625,874 [75%]) and VA (895,992 [41%]) health care utilization was more significant. The value added for utilizing DaVINCI in longitudinal studies was the highest for researchers normally limited to DoD data only. For beneficiaries who had 5 years of continuous enrollment, DaVINCI increased the potential study population by over 202% compared to using DoD data alone and by over 14% compared to VA data alone. Among beneficiaries with 20 years of continuous enrollment, DaVINCI increased the potential study population by over 133% compared to DoD data and by nearly 39% compared to VA data. CONCLUSIONS: DaVINCI has successfully combined DoD and VA data and utilized OMOP CDM to standardize health care concepts. However, to fully maximize the potential of DaVINCI's DoD and VA OMOP databases, researchers must uniquely categorize the DaVINCI cohort and build longitudinal patient records across DoD and VA. Because of the low other health insurance rates among DoD enrollees and their choice to enroll to a DoD Primary Care Manager, we believe this population to be the least censored in the DoD. Applying a similar concept through VA's priority groups (1-5) would enable researchers to follow ADSMs as they transition from the military.",Illustration of Continuous Enrollment and Beneficiary Categorization in DoD and VA Infrastructure for Clinical Intelligence.,"['Humans', '*Veterans', '*Military Personnel', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Intelligence']",,

METHODS: This study involved retrospective cohort data of 950,751 patients from a 20-year database (2001 to 2020) of Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership CDM. One-way analysis of variance models and the chi(2) test were used to analyze the statistical differences in patient characteristics among groups. A time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, and P values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: Of the 29,729 patients, 1,307 patients were diagnosed with periodontitis and 28,422 patients were not. Periodontitis was significantly more common among postmenopausal patients regardless of HRT status than among the non-menopausal group (P<0.05). Time-dependent Cox regression analysis showed that the postmenopausal patients had a significantly higher chance of having periodontitis than non-menopausal patients (P<0.05), but after adjustment for age, body mass index, and smoking status, the difference between the non-menopausal and post-menopausal HRT-treated groups was insignificant (P=0.140). CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal women had a significantly greater risk of periodontitis than non-menopausal women. Additionally, the use of HRT in postmenopausal women could reduce the incidence of periodontitis.",Association of periodontitis with menopause and hormone replacement therapy: a hospital cohort study using a common data model.,,,

However, acquiring data from multiple institutions from many countries requires enormous effort because of financial, technical, ethical, and legal issues as well as standardization of data structure and semantics.

As a demonstration, cross-validation and independent testing were performed with iADRGSE on a dataset of ADRs classified into 27 categories, based on SOC (system organ classification). In addition, experiments comparing iADRGSE with approaches such as NPF were conducted on the OMOP dataset, using the jackknife test method.

However, long COVID is incompletely understood and characterised by a wide range of manifestations that are difficult to analyse computationally. Additionally, the generalisability of machine learning classification of COVID-19 clinical outcomes has rarely been tested. METHODS: We present a method for computationally modelling PASC phenotype data based on electronic healthcare records (EHRs) and for assessing pairwise phenotypic similarity between patients using semantic similarity. Our approach defines a nonlinear similarity function that maps from a feature space of phenotypic abnormalities to a matrix of pairwise patient similarity that can be clustered using unsupervised machine learning. FINDINGS: We found six clusters of PASC patients, each with distinct profiles of phenotypic abnormalities, including clusters with distinct pulmonary, neuropsychiatric, and cardiovascular abnormalities, and a cluster associated with broad, severe manifestations and increased mortality. There was significant association of cluster membership with a range of pre-existing conditions and measures of severity during acute COVID-19. We assigned new patients from other healthcare centres to clusters by maximum semantic similarity to the original patients, and showed that the clusters were generalisable across different hospital systems. The increased mortality rate originally identified in one cluster was consistently observed in patients assigned to that cluster in other hospital systems. INTERPRETATION: Semantic phenotypic clustering provides a foundation for assigning patients to stratified subgroups for natural history or therapy studies on PASC.

To date, however, rare attempts exist to leverage CDM data for healthcare process mining, a technique to derive process-related knowledge (e.g., process model) from event logs. This paper presents a method to extract, construct, and analyze event logs from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM for process mining and demonstrates CDM-based healthcare process mining with several real-life study cases while answering frequently posed questions in process mining, in the CDM environment. METHODS: We propose a method to extract, construct, and analyze event logs from the OMOP CDM for process types including inpatient, outpatient, emergency room processes, and patient journey. Using the proposed method, we extract the retrospective data of several surgical procedure cases (i.e., Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH), Total Hip Replacement (THR), Coronary Bypass (CB), Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD)) from the CDM of a Korean tertiary hospital. Patient data are extracted for each of the operations and analyzed using several process mining techniques. RESULTS: Using process mining, the clinical pathways, outpatient process models, emergency room process models, and patient journeys are demonstrated using the extracted logs. The result shows CDM's usability as a novel and valuable data source for healthcare process analysis, yet with a few considerations. We found that CDM should be complemented by different internal and external data sources to address the administrative and operational aspects of healthcare processes, particularly for outpatient and ER process analyses. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit CDM for healthcare process mining. Specifically, we provide a step-by-step guidance by demonstrating process analysis from locating relevant CDM tables to visualizing results using process mining tools. The proposed method can be widely applicable across different institutions. This work can contribute to bringing a process mining perspective to the existing CDM users in the changing Hospital Information Systems (HIS) environment and also to facilitating CDM-based studies in the process mining research community.",Exploring the potential of OMOP common data model for process mining in healthcare.,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Data Management', '*Health Facilities', 'Databases, Factual', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Electronic Health Records']",,

DESIGN: A prevalent user and active comparator cohort study. SETTING: Two US claims databases (Open Claims and PharMetrics Plus) mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. PARTICIPANTS: Insured patients with a history of osteoarthritis or back pain and receiving ibuprofen, other ns-NSAIDs, COX-2i or paracetamol between 1 November, 2019 and 31 January, 2020 (study enrolment window 1) or between 1 February, 2020 and 31 October, 2020 (study enrolment window 2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Large-scale propensity score matching and empirical calibration were used to minimise confounding. Incidence and hazard ratios of COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalisation according to drug/s use were estimated and pooled in the same study period across data sources using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Index treatment episode was the primary risk evaluation window, censored at the time of discontinuation. RESULTS: A total of 633,562 and 1,063,960 participants were included in periods 1 and 2, respectively, for the ibuprofen versus ns-NSAIDs comparison, 311,669 and 524,470 for ibuprofen versus COX-2i, and 492,002 and 878,598 for ibuprofen versus paracetamol. Meta-analyses of empirically calibrated hazard ratios revealed no significantly differential risk of COVID-19 outcomes in users of ibuprofen versus any of the other studied analgesic classes: hazard ratios were 1.13 (0.96-1.33) for the ibuprofen-ns-NSAIDs comparison, 1.03 (0.83-1.28) for the ibuprofen-COX-2i comparison and 1.13 (0.74-1.73) for ibuprofen-paracetamol comparison on COVID-19 diagnosis in the February 2020-October 2020 window. Similar hazard ratios were found on COVID-19 hospitalisation and across both study periods. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with osteoarthritis or back pain, we found no differential risks of incident COVID-19 diagnosis or COVID-19 hospitalisation for ibuprofen users compared with other ns-NSAIDs, COX-2i or paracetamol. Our findings support regulatory recommendations that NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, should be prescribed as indicated in the same way as before the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those who rely on ibuprofen or NSAIDs to manage chronic arthritis or musculoskeletal pain symptoms.",Risk of COVID-19 Diagnosis and Hospitalisation in Patients with Osteoarthritis or Back Pain Treated with Ibuprofen Compared to Other NSAIDs or Paracetamol: A Network Cohort Study.,"['Humans', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Ibuprofen/therapeutic use', 'Acetaminophen/therapeutic use', 'COVID-19 Testing', 'Cohort Studies', 'Pandemics', '*COVID-19', '*Osteoarthritis/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Back Pain/diagnosis/drug therapy/chemically induced']",,

In this context, real-world data and their accessibility are of increasing importance to support unbiased and reliable research on big data. However, routinely collected data are not readily usable for research owing to the unstructured nature of health care systems and a lack of interoperability between these systems. This challenge is evident in drug data. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present an approach that identifies and increases the structuredness of drug data while ensuring standardization according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. METHODS: Our approach was based on available drug prescriptions and a drug catalog and consisted of 4 steps. First, we performed an initial analysis of the structuredness of local drug data to define a point of comparison for the effectiveness of the overall approach. Second, we applied 3 algorithms to unstructured data that translated text into ATC codes based on string comparisons in terms of ingredients and product names and performed similarity comparisons based on Levenshtein distance. Third, we validated the results of the 3 algorithms with expert knowledge based on the 1000 most frequently used prescription texts. Fourth, we performed a final validation to determine the increased degree of structuredness. RESULTS: Initially, 47.73% (n=843,980) of 1,768,153 drug prescriptions were classified as structured. With the application of the 3 algorithms, we were able to increase the degree of structuredness to 85.18% (n=1,506,059) based on the 1000 most frequent medication prescriptions. In this regard, the combination of algorithms 1, 2, and 3 resulted in a correctness level of 100% (with 57,264 ATC codes identified), algorithms 1 and 3 resulted in 99.6% (with 152,404 codes identified), and algorithms 1 and 2 resulted in 95.9% (with 39,472 codes identified). CONCLUSIONS: As shown in the first analysis steps of our approach, the availability of a product catalog to select during the documentation process is not sufficient to generate structured data. Our 4-step approach reduces the problems and reliably increases the structuredness automatically. Similarity matching shows promising results, particularly for entries with no connection to a product catalog. However, further enhancement of the correctness of such a similarity matching algorithm needs to be investigated in future work.",Assessment and Improvement of Drug Data Structuredness From Electronic Health Records: Algorithm Development and Validation.,,,

The objective of this research was to develop phenotype algorithms for SLE suitable for use in epidemiological studies using empirical evidence from observational databases. METHODS: We used a process for empirically determining and evaluating phenotype algorithms for health conditions to be analyzed in observational research. The process started with a literature search to discover prior algorithms used for SLE. We then used a set of Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) open-source tools to refine and validate the algorithms. These included tools to discover codes for SLE that may have been missed in prior studies and to determine possible low specificity and index date misclassification in algorithms for correction. RESULTS: We developed four algorithms using our process: two algorithms for prevalent SLE and two for incident SLE. The algorithms for both incident and prevalent cases are comprised of a more specific version and a more sensitive version. Each of the algorithms corrects for possible index date misclassification. After validation, we found the highest positive predictive value estimate for the prevalent, specific algorithm (89%). The highest sensitivity estimate was found for the sensitive, prevalent algorithm (77%). CONCLUSION: We developed phenotype algorithms for SLE using a data-driven approach. The four final algorithms may be used directly in observational studies. The validation of these algorithms provides researchers an added measure of confidence that the algorithms are selecting subjects correctly and allows for the application of quantitative bias analysis.",Using a data-driven approach for the development and evaluation of phenotype algorithms for systemic lupus erythematosus.,"['Humans', '*Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Algorithms', 'Databases, Factual']",,

The aim of the study is to provide a large-scale characterization of COVID-19 patients with COPD. Methods: We included thirteen databases contributing data from January-June 2020 from North America (US), Europe and Asia. We defined two cohorts of patients with COVID-19 namely a 'diagnosed' and 'hospitalized' cohort. We followed patients from COVID-19 index date to 30 days or death. We performed descriptive analysis and reported the frequency of characteristics and outcomes among COPD patients with COVID-19. Results: The study included 934,778 patients in the diagnosed COVID-19 cohort and 177,201 in the hospitalized COVID-19 cohort. Observed COPD prevalence in the diagnosed cohort ranged from 3.8% (95%CI 3.5-4.1%) in French data to 22.7% (95%CI 22.4-23.0) in US data, and from 1.9% (95%CI 1.6-2.2) in South Korean to 44.0% (95%CI 43.1-45.0) in US data, in the hospitalized cohorts. COPD patients in the hospitalized cohort had greater comorbidity than those in the diagnosed cohort, including hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Mortality was higher in COPD patients in the hospitalized cohort and ranged from 7.6% (95%CI 6.9-8.4) to 32.2% (95%CI 28.0-36.7) across databases. ARDS, acute renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia and sepsis were the most common outcomes among hospitalized COPD patients. Conclusion: COPD patients with COVID-19 have high levels of COVID-19-associated comorbidities and poor COVID-19 outcomes.

OntoCR, a clinical repository developed at Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, uses ontologies to represent clinical knowledge and map locally defined variables to health information standards and common data models. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to design and implement a scalable methodology based on the dual-model paradigm and the use of ontologies to consolidate clinical data from different organizations in a standardized repository for research purposes without loss of meaning. METHODS: First, the relevant clinical variables are defined, and the corresponding European Norm/International Organization for Standardization (EN/ISO) 13606 archetypes are created. Data sources are then identified, and an extract, transform, and load process is carried out. Once the final data set is obtained, the data are transformed to create EN/ISO 13606-normalized electronic health record (EHR) extracts. Afterward, ontologies that represent archetyped concepts and map them to EN/ISO 13606 and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) standards are created and uploaded to OntoCR. Data stored in the extracts are inserted into its corresponding place in the ontology, thus obtaining instantiated patient data in the ontology-based repository. Finally, data can be extracted via SPARQL queries as OMOP CDM-compliant tables. RESULTS: Using this methodology, EN/ISO 13606-standardized archetypes that allow for the reuse of clinical information were created, and the knowledge representation of our clinical repository by modeling and mapping ontologies was extended. Furthermore, EN/ISO 13606-compliant EHR extracts of patients (6803), episodes (13,938), diagnosis (190,878), administered medication (222,225), cumulative drug dose (222,225), prescribed medication (351,247), movements between units (47,817), clinical observations (6,736,745), laboratory observations (3,392,873), limitation of life-sustaining treatment (1,298), and procedures (19,861) were created. Since the creation of the application that inserts data from extracts into the ontologies is not yet finished, the queries were tested and the methodology was validated by importing data from a random subset of patients into the ontologies using a locally developed Protege plugin (""OntoLoad""). In total, 10 OMOP CDM-compliant tables (""Condition_occurrence,"" 864 records; ""Death,"" 110; ""Device_exposure,"" 56; ""Drug_exposure,"" 5609; ""Measurement,"" 2091; ""Observation,"" 195; ""Observation_period,"" 897; ""Person,"" 922; ""Visit_detail,"" 772; and ""Visit_occurrence,"" 971) were successfully created and populated. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a methodology for standardizing clinical data, thus allowing its reuse without any changes in the meaning of the modeled concepts. Although this paper focuses on health research, our methodology suggests that the data be initially standardized per EN/ISO 13606 to obtain EHR extracts with a high level of granularity that can be used for any purpose. Ontologies constitute a valuable approach for knowledge representation and standardization of health information in a standard-agnostic manner. With the proposed methodology, institutions can go from local raw data to standardized, semantically interoperable EN/ISO 13606 and OMOP repositories.",An Ontology-Based Approach for Consolidating Patient Data Standardized With European Norm/International Organization for Standardization 13606 (EN/ISO 13606) Into Joint Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Repositories: Description of a Methodology.,,,

METHODS: Individuals exposed to bumetanide or furosemide were identified in the Stanford University electronic health record using the deidentified Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership platform. We matched the AD case cohort to a control cohort (1:20 case:control) on gender, race, ethnicity, hypertension and controlled for variables that could potentially be collinear with bumetanide exposure and/or AD diagnosis. Among individuals older than 65 years, 5,839 AD cases and 116,103 matched controls were included. A total of 1,759 patients (54 cases, 1,705 controls) were exposed to bumetanide. RESULTS: After adjusting for socioeconomic status and other confounders, bumetanide exposure was significantly associated with reduced AD risk (odds ratio = 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.68; p = 9.9x10(-6)), while the most common loop diuretics, furosemide, was not associated with AD risk. CONCLUSION: Our study replicates in an independent sample that history of bumetanide exposure is associated with reduced risk of AD and emphasizes that this association is not confounded by difference in socioeconomic status, which was an important caveat given the cost difference between bumetanide and furosemide.",Bumetanide Exposure Association with Alzheimer's Disease Risk.,,,

However, there are concerns related to data sharing among multicenter networks. Clinical data can be shielded by firewalls using distributed research networks (DRNs). We attempted to develop DRNs for multicenter research that can be easily installed and used by any institution. Patients and Methods: We propose a DRN for multicenter cancer research called the cancer research line (CAREL) and present a data catalog based on a common data model (CDM). CAREL was validated using 1723 patients with prostate cancer and 14 990 patients with lung cancer in a retrospective study. We used the attribute-value pairs and array data type JavaScript object notation (JSON) format to interface third-party security solutions such as blockchain. Results: We developed visualized data catalogs of prostate and lung cancer based on the observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) CDM, from which researchers can easily browse and select relevant data. We made the CAREL source code readily available for download and application for relevant purposes. In addition, it is possible to realize a multicenter research network using CAREL development sources. Conclusion: CAREL source can enable medical institutions to participate in multicenter cancer research. Our technology is open source, so small institutions that cannot afford to spend high costs can use it to develop a platform for multicenter research.",Cancer Research Line (CAREL): Development of Expanded Distributed Research Networks for Prostate Cancer and Lung Cancer.,"['Male', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Prostatic Neoplasms/therapy', '*Lung Neoplasms', '*Biomedical Research']",,

The Predictive Approaches to Treatment Effect Heterogeneity (PATH) statement focused on baseline risk as a robust predictor of treatment effect and provided guidance on risk-based assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity in a randomized controlled trial. The aim of this study is to extend this approach to the observational setting using a standardized scalable framework. The proposed framework consists of five steps: (1) definition of the research aim, i.e., the population, the treatment, the comparator and the outcome(s) of interest; (2) identification of relevant databases; (3) development of a prediction model for the outcome(s) of interest; (4) estimation of relative and absolute treatment effect within strata of predicted risk, after adjusting for observed confounding; (5) presentation of the results. We demonstrate our framework by evaluating heterogeneity of the effect of thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on three efficacy and nine safety outcomes across three observational databases. We provide a publicly available R software package for applying this framework to any database mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. In our demonstration, patients at low risk of acute myocardial infarction receive negligible absolute benefits for all three efficacy outcomes, though they are more pronounced in the highest risk group, especially for acute myocardial infarction. Our framework allows for the evaluation of differential treatment effects across risk strata, which offers the opportunity to consider the benefit-harm trade-off between alternative treatments.",A standardized framework for risk-based assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity in observational healthcare databases.,,,

GenoMed4All is one such project, with the goal of connecting European clinical and -omics data repositories on rare diseases through a federated learning platform. Currently, the consortium faces the challenge of a lack of well-established international datasets and interoperability standards for federated learning applications on rare diseases. This paper presents our practical approach to select and implement a Common Data Model (CDM) suitable for the federated training of predictive models applied to the medical domain, during the initial design phase of our federated learning platform. We describe our selection process, composed of identifying the consortium's needs, reviewing our functional and technical architecture specifications, and extracting a list of business requirements. We review the state of the art and evaluate three widely-used approaches (FHIR, OMOP and Phenopackets) based on a checklist of requirements and specifications. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach considering the use cases specific to our consortium as well as the generic issues of implementing a European federated learning healthcare platform. A list of lessons learned from the experience in our consortium is discussed, from the importance of establishing the proper communication channels for all stakeholders to technical aspects related to -omics data. For federated learning projects focused on secondary use of health data for predictive modeling, encompassing multiple data modalities, a phase of data model convergence is sorely needed to gather different data representations developed in the context of medical research, interoperability of clinical care software, imaging, and -omics analysis into a coherent, unified data model.

Some AESIs are not only associated with the vaccines, but with COVID-19. Our aim was to characterise the incidence rates of AESIs following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and compare these to historical rates in the general population. METHODS: A multi-national cohort study with data from primary care, electronic health records, and insurance claims mapped to a common data model. This study's evidence was collected between Jan 1, 2017 and the conclusion of each database (which ranged from Jul 2020 to May 2022). The 16 pre-specified prevalent AESIs were: acute myocardial infarction, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell's palsy, deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalomyelitis, Guillain- Barre syndrome, haemorrhagic stroke, non-haemorrhagic stroke, immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis/pericarditis, narcolepsy, pulmonary embolism, transverse myelitis, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Age-sex standardised incidence rate ratios (SIR) were estimated to compare post-COVID-19 to pre-pandemic rates in each of the databases. FINDINGS: Substantial heterogeneity by age was seen for AESI rates, with some clearly increasing with age but others following the opposite trend. Similarly, differences were also observed across databases for same health outcome and age-sex strata. All studied AESIs appeared consistently more common in the post-COVID-19 compared to the historical cohorts, with related meta-analytic SIRs ranging from 1.32 (1.05 to 1.66) for narcolepsy to 11.70 (10.10 to 13.70) for pulmonary embolism. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest all AESIs are more common after COVID-19 than in the general population. Thromboembolic events were particularly common, and over 10-fold more so.

Yet, many trials fail to do so, leading to delays, early trial termination, and wasted resources. Under-enrolling trials make it impossible to draw conclusions about the efficacy of new therapies. An oft-cited reason for insufficient enrollment is lack of study team and provider awareness about patient eligibility. Automating clinical trial eligibility surveillance and study team and provider notification could offer a solution. METHODS: To address this need for an automated solution, we conducted an observational pilot study of our TAES (TriAl Eligibility Surveillance) system. We tested the hypothesis that an automated system based on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms could detect patients eligible for specific clinical trials by linking the information extracted from trial descriptions to the corresponding clinical information in the electronic health record (EHR). To evaluate the TAES information extraction and matching prototype (i.e., TAES prototype), we selected five open cardiovascular and cancer trials at the Medical University of South Carolina and created a new reference standard of 21,974 clinical text notes from a random selection of 400 patients (including at least 100 enrolled in the selected trials), with a small subset of 20 notes annotated in detail. We also developed a simple web interface for a new database that stores all trial eligibility criteria, corresponding clinical information, and trial-patient match characteristics using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Finally, we investigated options for integrating an automated clinical trial eligibility system into the EHR and for notifying health care providers promptly of potential patient eligibility without interrupting their clinical workflow. RESULTS: Although the rapidly implemented TAES prototype achieved only moderate accuracy (recall up to 0.778; precision up to 1.000), it enabled us to assess options for integrating an automated system successfully into the clinical workflow at a healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS: Once optimized, the TAES system could exponentially enhance identification of patients potentially eligible for clinical trials, while simultaneously decreasing the burden on research teams of manual EHR review. Through timely notifications, it could also raise physician awareness of patient eligibility for clinical trials.",Piloting an automated clinical trial eligibility surveillance and provider alert system based on artificial intelligence and standard data models.,"['Humans', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Pilot Projects', 'Patient Selection', '*Natural Language Processing', 'Machine Learning']",,

encounter data are heterogeneous and vary greatly from institution to institution. These problems of variance affect interpretability and usability of clinical encounter data for analysis. These problems are magnified when multisite electronic health record (EHR) data are networked together. This article presents a novel, generalizable method for resolving encounter heterogeneity for analysis by combining related atomic encounters into composite ""macrovisits."" MATERIALS AND METHODS: Encounters were composed of data from 75 partner sites harmonized to a common data model as part of the NIH Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery Initiative, a project of the National Covid Cohort Collaborative. Summary statistics were computed for overall and site-level data to assess issues and identify modifications. Two algorithms were developed to refine atomic encounters into cleaner, analyzable longitudinal clinical visits. RESULTS: Atomic inpatient encounters data were found to be widely disparate between sites in terms of length-of-stay (LOS) and numbers of OMOP CDM measurements per encounter. After aggregating encounters to macrovisits, LOS and measurement variance decreased. A subsequent algorithm to identify hospitalized macrovisits further reduced data variability. DISCUSSION: Encounters are a complex and heterogeneous component of EHR data and native data issues are not addressed by existing methods. These types of complex and poorly studied issues contribute to the difficulty of deriving value from EHR data, and these types of foundational, large-scale explorations, and developments are necessary to realize the full potential of modern real-world data. CONCLUSION: This article presents method developments to manipulate and resolve EHR encounter data issues in a generalizable way as a foundation for future research and analysis.",Clinical encounter heterogeneity and methods for resolving in networked EHR data: a study from N3C and RECOVER programs.,"['Humans', '*Electronic Health Records', '*COVID-19', 'Health Facilities', 'Algorithms', 'Length of Stay']",,

In this paper, we propose two novel network representation learning methods (HARE and T-HARE) for signal detection that jointly utilize association information between drugs and medical outcomes from the FAERS and ancestral information in medical ontologies. We evaluate these methods using two publicly available reference datasets, EU-ADR and OMOP corpus. Experimental results showed that the proposed methods significantly outper-formed standard methodologies based on disproportionality metrics and the existing state-of-the-art aer2vec method with statistically significant improvements on both EU-ADR and OMOP datasets.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified the prescreening information items being relevant for prescreening of patients with cancer. We randomly selected 15 academic and industry-sponsored urology phase I-IV clinical trials (CTs) launched at APHP between 2016 and 2021. The computability of the related prescreening criteria (PC) was defined by their translation rate in OMOP-compliant queries and by their execution rate on the APHP clinical data warehouse (CDW) containing data of 205,977 patients with cancer. The overall performance of the prescreening tool was assessed by the rate of true- and false-positive cases of three randomly selected CTs. RESULTS: We defined a list of 15 minimal information items being relevant for patients' prescreening. We identified 83 PC of the 534 eligibility criteria from the 15 CTs. We translated 33 and 62 PC in queries on the basis of OMOP CDM v5.3 and v5.4, respectively (translation rates of 40% and 75%, respectively). Of the 33 PC translated in the v5.3 of the OMOP CDM, 19 could be executed on the APHP CDW (execution rate of 58%). Of 83 PC, the computability rate on the APHP CDW reached 23%. On the basis of three CTs, we identified 17, 32, and 63 patients as being potentially eligible for inclusion in those CTs, resulting in positive predictive values of 53%, 41%, and 21%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We showed that PC could be formalized according to the OMOP CDM and that the oncology extension increased their translation rate through better representation of cancer natural history.",How to Improve Cancer Patients ENrollment in Clinical Trials From rEal-Life Databases Using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Oncology Extension: Results of the PENELOPE Initiative in Urologic Cancers.,"['Humans', 'Data Warehousing', 'Databases, Factual', '*Urology', '*Urologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/therapy']",,

We compared long-term mortality with PACE using data from nationwide multicenter electronic health records. METHODS: Data from 7 hospitals, converted to Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, were used. We extracted records of 277,787 adult patients over 18 years old undergoing non-cardiac surgery for the first time at the hospital and had medical records for more than 180 days before surgery. We performed propensity score matching and then an aggregated meta‑analysis. RESULTS: After 1:4 propensity score matching, 7,970 patients with PACE and 28,807 patients without PACE were matched. The meta‑analysis showed that PACE was associated with higher one-year mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.33, 95% CI [1.10, 1.60], P = 0.005) and higher three-year mortality (HR: 1.18, 95% CI [1.01, 1.38], P = 0.038). In subgroup analysis, the risk of one-year mortality by PACE became greater with higher-risk surgical procedures (HR: 1.20, 95% CI [1.04, 1.39], P = 0.020 for low-risk surgery; HR: 1.69, 95% CI [1.45, 1.96], P < 0.001 for intermediate-risk; and HR: 2.38, 95% CI [1.47, 3.86], P = 0.034 for high-risk). CONCLUSIONS: A nationwide multicenter study showed that PACE was significantly associated with increased one-year mortality. This association was stronger in high-risk surgery, older, male, and chronic kidney disease subgroups.

This study uses a mixed-methods approach to develop and evaluate a novel metadata framework for retrieval of and reusing computational phenotypes. Twenty active phenotyping researchers from 2 large research networks, Electronic Medical Records and Genomics and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics, were recruited to suggest metadata elements. Once consensus was reached on 39 metadata elements, 47 new researchers were surveyed to evaluate the utility of the metadata framework. The survey consisted of 5-Likert multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. Two more researchers were asked to use the metadata framework to annotate 8 type-2 diabetes mellitus phenotypes. More than 90% of the survey respondents rated metadata elements regarding phenotype definition and validation methods and metrics positively with a score of 4 or 5. Both researchers completed annotation of each phenotype within 60 min. Our thematic analysis of the narrative feedback indicates that the metadata framework was effective in capturing rich and explicit descriptions and enabling the search for phenotypes, compliance with data standards, and comprehensive validation metrics. Current limitations were its complexity for data collection and the entailed human costs.",A metadata framework for computational phenotypes.,,,

Previous public databases can be used for clinical studies, but there is no common standard that would allow databases to be combined. For this reason, it is difficult to conduct research that derives results by combining databases. Recent commercial ECG machines offer diagnoses similar to those of a physician. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to construct a standardized ECG database using computerized diagnoses. METHODS: The constructed database was standardized using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-common data model (OMOP-CDM), and data were then categorized into 10 groups based on the Minnesota classification. In addition, to extract high-quality waveforms, poor-quality ECGs were removed, and database bias was minimized by extracting at least 2,000 cases for each group. To check database quality, the difference in baseline displacement according to whether poor ECGs were removed was analyzed, and the usefulness of the database was verified with seven classification models using waveforms. RESULTS: The standardized KURIAS-ECG database consists of high-quality ECGs from 13,862 patients, with about 20,000 data points, making it possible to obtain more than 2,000 for each Minnesota classification. An artificial intelligence classification model using the data extracted through SNOMED-CT showed an average accuracy of 88.03%. CONCLUSIONS: The KURIAS-ECG database contains standardized ECG data extracted from various machines. The proposed protocol should promote cardiovascular disease research using big data and artificial intelligence.",Standardized Database of 12-Lead Electrocardiograms with a Common Standard for the Promotion of Cardiovascular Research: KURIAS-ECG.,,,

For this purpose, a federated learning (FL) method based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) was implemented, and its feasibility was demonstrated. METHODS: We implemented an FL platform on FeederNet, which is a distributed clinical data analysis platform based on the OMOP CDM in Korea. We trained it through an artificial neural network (ANN) using data from patients who received steroid prescriptions or injections, with the aim of predicting the occurrence of side effects depending on the prescribed dose. The ANN was trained using the FL platform with the OMOP CDMs of Kyung Hee University Medical Center (KHMC) and Ajou University Hospital (AUH). RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) for predicting bone fracture, osteonecrosis, and osteoporosis using only data from each hospital were 0.8426, 0.6920, and 0.7727 for KHMC and 0.7891, 0.7049, and 0.7544 for AUH, respectively. In contrast, when using FL, the corresponding AUROCs were 0.8260, 0.7001, and 0.7928 for KHMC and 0.7912, 0.8076, and 0.7441 for AUH, respectively. In particular, FL led to a 14% improvement in performance for osteonecrosis at AUH. CONCLUSIONS: FL can be performed with the OMOP CDM, and FL often shows better performance than using only a single institution's data. Therefore, research using OMOP CDM has been expanded from statistical analysis to machine learning so that researchers can conduct more diverse research.",Feasibility Study of Federated Learning on the Distributed Research Network of OMOP Common Data Model.,,,

For instance, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is currently in the process of establishing a cross-national research network that utilizes RWD for research. However, data harmonization across countries must be carefully considered to avoid misclassification and bias. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to investigate the extent to which a correct assignment of RxNorm ingredients is possible for medication orders that include only ATC codes. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 1,506,059 medication orders from the University Hospital Dresden (UKD) and merged them with the ATC vocabulary in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) including relevant relationship mappings to RxNorm. RESULTS: We identified 70.25% of all medication orders were single ingredients with direct mapping to RxNorm. However, we also identified a significant complexity in mappings for the other medication orders that was visualized in an interactive scatterplot. DISCUSSION: The majority of medication orders under observation (70.25%) are single ingredients and can be standardized to RxNorm, combination drugs pose a challenge due to the different approaches of ingredient assignments in ATC and RxNorm. The provided visualization can help research teams gain a better understanding of problematic data and further investigate identified issues.",Fitness for Use of Anatomical Therapeutic Classification for Real World Data Research.,"['Humans', '*Vocabulary, Controlled', '*RxNorm', 'Records', 'Vocabulary', 'Hospitals, University']",,

of standardizing electronic health record (EHR) data but are unable to semantically integrate all of the resources needed for deep phenotyping. Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry ontologies provide computable representations of biological knowledge and enable the integration of heterogeneous data. However, mapping EHR data to OBO ontologies requires significant manual curation and domain expertise. We introduce OMOP2OBO, an algorithm for mapping Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) vocabularies to OBO ontologies. Using OMOP2OBO, we produced mappings for 92,367 conditions, 8611 drug ingredients, and 10,673 measurement results, which covered 68-99% of concepts used in clinical practice when examined across 24 hospitals. When used to phenotype rare disease patients, the mappings helped systematically identify undiagnosed patients who might benefit from genetic testing. By aligning OMOP vocabularies to OBO ontologies our algorithm presents new opportunities to advance EHR-based deep phenotyping.",Ontologizing health systems data at scale: making translational discovery a reality.,,,

METHODS: SEnDAE includes optional components for geocoding addresses, in case an organization does not have independent capabilities in that area, and recipes for extending the OMOP CDM and the ontology of an i2b2 instance to display and compute over the SEnDAE variables within i2b2. RESULTS: On a set of 5000 synthetic addresses, SEnDAE was able to geocode 83%. SEnDAE geocodes addresses to the same Census tract as ESRI 98.1% of the time.

A prevailing method to model databases for interoperability is the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), developed by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative. A European repository for OMOP CDM-converted databases called the ""European Health Data & Evidence Network (EHDEN) portal"" was developed, aiming to make these databases Findable and Accessible. This paper aims to assess the FAIRness of databases on the EHDEN portal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two researchers involved in the OMOP CDM conversion of separate Dutch Intensive Care Unit (ICU) research databases each manually assessed their own database using seventeen metrics. These were defined by the FAIRsFAIR project as a list of minimum requirements for a database to be FAIR. Each metric is given a score from zero to four based on how well the database adheres to the metric. The maximum score for each metric varies from one to four based on the importance of the metric. RESULTS: Fourteen out of the seventeen metrics were unanimously rated: seven were rated the highest score, one was rated half of the highest score, and five were rated the lowest score. The remaining three metrics were assessed differently for the two use cases. The total scores achieved were 15.5 and 12 out of a maximum of 25. CONCLUSION: The main omissions in supporting FAIRness were the lack of globally unique identifiers such as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in the OMOP CDM and the lack of metadata standardization and linkage in the EHDEN portal. By implementing these in future updates, the EHDEN portal can be more FAIR.",Assessing the FAIRness of databases on the EHDEN portal: A case study on two Dutch ICU databases.,"['Humans', '*Ethnicity', 'Databases, Factual', '*Health Facilities', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Electronic Health Records']",,

METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model database of treatment-naive patients with mCNV over the 18-year study period (2003-2020). Outcomes were treatment intensity (time trends of total/average number of prescriptions, mean number of prescriptions in the first year and the second year after initiating treatment, proportion of patients with no treatment in the second year) and treatment patterns (subsequent patterns of treatment according to the initial treatment). RESULTS: Our final cohort included 94 patients with at-least 1-year observation period. Overall, 96.8% of patients received anti-VEGF drugs as first-line treatment, with most of injections from bevacizumab. The number of anti-VEGF injections in each calendar year showed an increasing trend over time; however, there was a drop in the mean number of injections in the second year compared to the first year from 2.09 to 0.47. About 77% of patients did not receive any treatment in their second year of treatment regardless of drugs. Most of patients (86.2%) followed non-switching monotherapy only and bevacizumab was the most popular choice either in the first-line (68.1%) or in the second-line (53.8%) of treatment. Aflibercept was increasingly used as the first-line treatment for patients with mCNV. CONCLUSION: Anti-VEGF drugs have become the treatment of choice and second-line treatment for mCNV over the past decade. Anti-VEGF drugs are effective for the treatment of mCNV as the non-switching monotherapy is the main treatment regimen in most cases and the number of treatments decreases significantly in the second year of treatment.",Real-World Treatment Intensity and Patterns in Patients With Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization: Common Data Model in Ophthalmology.,"['Humans', '*Ophthalmology', 'Bevacizumab', 'Databases, Factual', 'Patients']",,

FINDINGS: Using 3 American (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV, electronic ICU) and 2 European (Amsterdam University Medical Center Database, High Time Resolution ICU Dataset) databases, we constructed a mapping for each database to a set of clinically relevant concepts, which are grounded in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Vocabulary wherever possible. Furthermore, we performed synchronization in the units of measurement and data type representation. On top of this, we built functionality, which allows the user to download, set up, and load data from all of the 5 databases, through a unified Application Programming Interface. The resulting ricu R-package represents the computational infrastructure for handling publicly available ICU datasets, and its latest release allows the user to load 119 existing clinical concepts from the 5 data sources. CONCLUSION: The ricu R-package (available on GitHub and CRAN) is the first tool that enables users to analyze publicly available ICU datasets simultaneously (datasets are available upon request from respective owners). Such an interface saves researchers time when analyzing ICU data and helps reproducibility. We hope that ricu can become a community-wide effort, so that data harmonization is not repeated by each research group separately. One current limitation is that concepts were added on a case-to-case basis, and therefore the resulting dictionary of concepts is not comprehensive.

PURPOSE: This study investigated the association between dyslipidemia and cholesterol levels in children. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify studies investigating the association between dyslipidemia and asthma in children. The PubMed database was searched for articles published from January 2000-March 2022. Data from a cohort study using electronic health records from 5 hospitals, converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM), were used to identify the association between total cholesterol (TC) levels and asthma in children. This cohort study used the Cox proportional hazards model to examine hazard ratio (HR) of asthma after propensity score matching, and included an aggregate meta-analysis of HR. RESULTS: We examined 11 studies reporting an association between dyslipidemia and asthma in children. Most were cross-sectional; however, their results were inconsistent. In OMOP-CDM multicenter analysis, the high TC (>170 mg/dL) group included 29,038 children, while the normal TC (</=170 mg/dL) group included 88,823 children including all hospital datasets. In a meta-analysis of this multicenter cohort, a significant association was found between high TC levels and later development of asthma in children <15 years of age (pooled HR, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.52).

The extent to which serial testing in real-world studies improves or hinders overall performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity remains unknown. METHODS: We assessed the overall performance of serial testing using three administrative claims and one electronic health record database. We compared type I and II errors before and after empirical calibration for historical comparator, self-controlled case series (SCCS), and the serial combination of those designs against six vaccine exposure groups with 93 negative control and 279 imputed positive control outcomes. RESULTS: The historical comparator design mostly had fewer type II errors than SCCS. SCCS had fewer type I errors than the historical comparator. Before empirical calibration, the serial combination increased specificity and decreased sensitivity. Type II errors mostly exceeded 50%. After empirical calibration, type I errors returned to nominal; sensitivity was lowest when the methods were combined. CONCLUSION: While serial combination produced fewer false-positive signals compared with the most specific method, it generated more false-negative signals compared with the most sensitive method. Using a historical comparator design followed by an SCCS analysis yielded decreased sensitivity in evaluating safety signals relative to a one-stage SCCS approach. While the current use of serial testing in vaccine surveillance may provide a practical paradigm for signal identification and triage, single epidemiological designs should be explored as valuable approaches to detecting signals.",Serially Combining Epidemiological Designs Does Not Improve Overall Signal Detection in Vaccine Safety Surveillance.,"['Humans', '*Vaccines/adverse effects', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Research Design', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records']",,

Extensive data on many aspects of the COVID-19 has been collected and used to optimize public health response to the pandemic and to manage the recovery of patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is no standard mechanism for collecting, documenting and disseminating COVID-19 related data or metadata, which makes the use and reuse a challenge. INSPIRE utilizes the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) as the Common Data Model (CDM) implemented in the cloud as a Platform as a Service (PaaS) for COVID-19 data. The INSPIRE PaaS for COVID-19 data leverages the cloud gateway for both individual research organizations and for data networks. Individual research institutions may choose to use the PaaS to access the FAIR data management, data analysis and data sharing capabilities which come with the OMOP CDM. Network data hubs may be interested in harmonizing data across localities using the CDM conditioned by the data ownership and data sharing agreements available under OMOP's federated model. The INSPIRE platform for evaluation of COVID-19 Harmonized data (PEACH) harmonizes data from Kenya and Malawi. Data sharing platforms must remain trusted digital spaces that protect human rights and foster citizens' participation is vital in an era where information overload from the internet exists. The channel for sharing data between localities is included in the PaaS and is based on data sharing agreements provided by the data producer. This allows the data producers to retain control over how their data are used, which can be further protected through the use of the federated CDM. Federated regional OMOP-CDM are based on the PaaS instances and analysis workbenches in INSPIRE-PEACH with harmonized analysis powered by the AI technologies in OMOP. These AI technologies can be used to discover and evaluate pathways that COVID-19 cohorts take through public health interventions and treatments.

As most patients fail to achieve alcohol abstinence, it is essential to identify alternative treatment options in order to improve the outcome of ALD patients. METHODS: Evaluating two large cohorts of patients with ALD from the USA and Korea with a total of 12,006 patients, we investigated the effect on survival of aspirin, metformin, metoprolol, dopamine, and dobutamine drugs in patients with ALD between 2000 and 2020. Patient data were obtained through the ""The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics consortium,"" an open-source, multi-stakeholder, and interdisciplinary collaborative effort. RESULTS: The use of aspirin (p = 0.000, p = 0.000), metoprolol (p = 0.002, p = 0.000), and metformin (p = 0.000, p = 0.000) confers a survival benefit for both AUSOM- and NY-treated cohorts. Need of catecholamines dobutamine (p = 0.000, p = 0.000) and dopamine (p = 0.000, p = 0.000) was strongly indicative of poor survival. beta-Blocker treatment with metoprolol (p = 0.128, p = 0.196) or carvedilol (p = 0.520, p = 0.679) was not shown to be protective in any of the female subgroups. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data fill a large gap in long-term, real-world data on patients with ALD, confirming an impact of metformin, acetylsalicylic acid, and beta-blockers on ALD patient's survival.

However, it can cause mild or severe hepatic adverse events and rarely fatal liver damage. This study was aimed at investigating hepatic toxicity caused by quetiapine use by analyzing the information captured from hospital electronic health records by using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (CDM). METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study involving a nested case-control method. A CDM based on an electronic health record database from five hospitals between January 2009 and May 2020 was used. We analyzed the status of quetiapine use, adverse events, and hepatic impairment. RESULTS: The numbers of patients with non-serious and severe hepatic adverse reactions were 2566 (5.05%) and 835 (1.64%) out of 50 766 patients, respectively. After adjusting for covariates, the odds ratio of hepatic adverse events was 2.35 (95% CI: 2.03-2.72), and the odds ratio of severe hepatic adverse events was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.16-2.66). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that quetiapine should be cautiously used, and hepatic function should be monitored in patients using quetiapine because it can cause mild or severe hepatic adverse events, complications, and in rare cases, fatal liver damage.",Investigation of hepatic adverse events due to quetiapine by using the common data model.,"['Humans', 'Quetiapine Fumarate/adverse effects', '*Antipsychotic Agents/adverse effects', '*Depressive Disorder, Major/drug therapy', '*Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy', 'Liver']",,

METHODS: HS adult and pediatric patients were identified in 3 the United States administrative claims databases during the study period between 2016 to 2021. Patients were required to have 2 diagnostic codes for HS and have at least 365 days of prior observation time to the first HS diagnosis. RESULTS: Pediatric and adult HS treatments were similar. The proportions of subjects treated with topical and oral antibiotic or oral antibiotic alone or topical medication alone or surgery alone covered 90% of the treated pediatric subjects and 91% of treated adult subjects. The remaining proportion of subjects received other treatment combinations. LIMITATIONS: The databases represent subjects with commercial or government insurance coverage and thus do not necessarily represent the broader US population.

PIONEER, funded by the European Commission Innovative Medicines Initiative, aims at improving PCa care across Europe through the application of big data analytics. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and long-term outcomes of PCa patients on conservative management by using an international large network of real-world data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From an initial cohort of >100 000 000 adult individuals included in eight databases evaluated during a virtual study-a-thon hosted by PIONEER, we identified newly diagnosed PCa cases (n = 527 311). Among those, we selected patients who did not receive curative or palliative treatment within 6 mo from diagnosis (n = 123 146). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Patient and disease characteristics were reported. The number of patients who experienced the main study outcomes was quantified for each stratum and the overall cohort. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate the distribution of time to event data. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The most common comorbidities were hypertension (35-73%), obesity (9.2-54%), and type 2 diabetes (11-28%). The rate of PCa-related symptomatic progression ranged between 2.6% and 6.2%. Hospitalization (12-25%) and emergency department visits (10-14%) were common events during the 1st year of follow-up. The probability of being free from both palliative and curative treatments decreased during follow-up. Limitations include a lack of information on patients and disease characteristics and on treatment intent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results allow us to better understand the current landscape of patients with PCa managed with conservative treatment. PIONEER offers a unique opportunity to characterize the baseline features and outcomes of PCa patients managed conservatively using real-world data. PATIENT SUMMARY: Up to 25% of men with prostate cancer (PCa) managed conservatively experienced hospitalization and emergency department visits within the 1st year after diagnosis; 6% experienced PCa-related symptoms.

The increased use of CDEs in large prior studies can guide researchers planning new studies. For that purpose, we analyzed the All of Us (AoU) program, an ongoing US study intending to enroll one million participants and serve as a platform for numerous observational analyses. AoU adopted the OMOP Common Data Model to standardize both research (Case Report Form [CRF]) and real-world (imported from Electronic Health Records [EHRs]) data. AoU standardized specific data elements and values by including CDEs from terminologies such as LOINC and SNOMED CT. For this study, we defined all elements from established terminologies as CDEs and all custom concepts created in the Participant Provided Information (PPI) terminology as unique data elements (UDEs). We found 1 033 research elements, 4 592 element-value combinations and 932 distinct values. Most elements were UDEs (869, 84.1%), while most CDEs were from LOINC (103 elements, 10.0%) or SNOMED CT (60, 5.8%). Of the LOINC CDEs, 87 (53.1% of 164 CDEs) originated from previous data collection initiatives, such as PhenX (17 CDEs) and PROMIS (15 CDEs). On a CRF level, The Basics (12 of 21 elements, 57.1%) and Lifestyle (10 of 14, 71.4%) were the only CRFs with multiple CDEs. On a value level, 61.7% of distinct values are from an established terminology. AoU demonstrates the use of the OMOP model for integrating research and routine healthcare data (64 elements in both contexts), which allows for monitoring lifestyle and health changes outside the research setting. The increased inclusion of CDEs in large studies (like AoU) is important in facilitating the use of existing tools and improving the ease of understanding and analyzing the data collected, which is more challenging when using study specific formats.",Learning important common data elements from shared study data: The All of Us program analysis.,"['Humans', '*Common Data Elements', '*Population Health', 'Data Collection', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Delivery of Health Care']",,

Epub 2023 Jul 12.,2023/07/13 19:24,Journal of biomedical informatics,"BACKGROUND: The reuse of data from electronic health records (EHRs) for research purposes promises to improve the data foundation for clinical trials and may even support to enable them. Nevertheless, EHRs are characterized by both, heterogeneous structure and semantics. To standardize this data for research, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) standard has recently seen an increase in use. However, the conversion of these EHRs into the OMOP CDM requires complex and resource intensive Extract Transform and Load (ETL) processes. This hampers the reuse of clinical data for research. To solve the issues of heterogeneity of EHRs and the lack of semantic precision on the care site, the openEHR standard has recently seen wider adoption. A standardized process to integrate openEHR records into the CDM potentially lowers the barriers of making EHRs accessible for research. Yet, a comprehensive approach about the integration of openEHR records into the OMOP CDM has not yet been made. METHODS: We analyzed both standards and compared their models to identify possible mappings. Based on this, we defined the necessary processes to transform openEHR records into CDM tables. We also discuss the limitation of openEHR with its unspecific demographics model and propose two possible solutions. RESULTS: We developed the OMOP Conversion Language (OMOCL) which enabled us to define a declarative openEHR archetype-to-CDM mapping language. Using OMOCL, it was possible to define a set of mappings. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented the Eos tool, which uses the OMOCL-files to successfully automatize the ETL from real-world and sample EHRs into the OMOP CDM. DISCUSSION: Both Eos and OMOCL provide a way to define generic mappings for an integration of openEHR records into OMOP. Thus, it represents a significant step towards achieving interoperability between the clinical and the research data domains. However, the transformation of openEHR data into the less expressive OMOP CDM leads to a loss of semantics.",Eos and OMOCL: Towards a seamless integration of openEHR records into the OMOP Common Data Model.,"['*Electronic Health Records', '*Semantics', 'Databases, Factual', 'Reference Standards']",,

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and TMD incidence using large-scale health data. Clinical data from the electronic health records of six secondary or tertiary hospitals in Korea were used to evaluate the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and TMD incidence. The data were converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. A cohort study was designed using the Cox proportional hazards model to examine the hazard ratio (HR) of TMD development after propensity score matching (PSM). An aggregate meta-analysis of the HR was subsequently performed. After 1:4 PSM, a target group with deficient 25(OH)D levels (<20 ng/mL) (N = 34,560) and comparator group with non-deficient 25(OH)D levels (>/=20 ng/mL) (N = 47,359) were pooled from six hospital databases. HR meta-analysis demonstrated a significant association between deficient 25(OH)D levels and TMD incidence (pooled HR: 1.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.07-2.12). In conclusion, deficient 25(OH)D levels were found to be associated with an increased TMD risk. Therefore, vitamin D deficiency is a potential risk factor for TMD development.","Association of Serum Vitamin D Level with Temporomandibular Disorder Incidence: A Retrospective, Multi-Center Cohort Study Using Six Hospital Databases.","['Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Cohort Studies', '*Vitamin D', '*Vitamin D Deficiency', 'Hospitals', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic']",,

Here, we undertook a systematic concept coverage analysis to determine the representation of clinical concepts in ophthalmic infection and ophthalmic trauma among standardized medical terminologies, including the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 10 with clinical modifications (ICD-10-CM), and ICD version 11 (ICD-11). DESIGN: Extraction of concepts related to ophthalmic infection and ophthalmic trauma and structured search in terminology browsers. DATA SOURCES: The American Academy of Ophthalmology Basic and Clinical Science Course (BCSC), SNOMED-CT, and ICD-10-CM terminologies from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics Athena browser, and the ICD-11 terminology browser. METHODS: Concepts pertaining to ophthalmic infection and ophthalmic trauma were extracted from the 2022 BCSC free text and index terms. We searched terminology browsers to identify corresponding codes and classified the extent of semantic alignment as equal, wide, narrow, or unmatched in each terminology. The overlap of equal concepts in each terminology was represented in a Venn diagram. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of clinical concepts with corresponding codes at various levels of semantic alignment. RESULTS: A total of 443 concepts were identified: 304 concepts related to ophthalmic infection and 139 concepts related to ophthalmic trauma. The SNOMED-CT had the highest proportion of equal coverage, with 82.0% (249 of 304) among concepts related to ophthalmic infection and 82.0% (115 of 139) among concepts related to ophthalmic trauma. Across all concepts, 28% (124 of 443) were classified as equal in ICD-10-CM and 52.8% (234 of 443) were classified as equal in ICD-11. CONCLUSIONS: The SNOMED-CT had significantly better semantic alignment than ICD-10-CM and ICD-11 for ophthalmic infections and ophthalmic trauma. This demonstrates opportunity for continuing advancement of representation of ophthalmic concepts in standardized medical terminologies.","Concept Coverage Analysis of Ophthalmic Infections and Trauma among the Standardized Medical Terminologies SNOMED-CT, ICD-10-CM, and ICD-11.",,,

Traditional randomized clinical trials that study and establish new interventions face challenges, such as high cost and time commitment. Observational studies that use existing clinical data to observe the effect of an intervention have shown several advantages over RCTs. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become an increasingly important resource for conducting observational studies. To support these studies, we developed a clinical research datamart, called ReDWINE (Rehabilitation Datamart With Informatics iNfrastructure for rEsearch), that transforms the rehabilitation-related EHR data collected from the UPMC health care system to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to facilitate rehabilitation research. The standardized EHR data stored in ReDWINE will further reduce the time and effort required by investigators to pool, harmonize, clean, and analyze data from multiple sources, leading to more robust and comprehensive research findings. ReDWINE also includes deployment of data visualization and data analytics tools to facilitate cohort definition and clinical data analysis. These include among others the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) toolkit, a high-throughput NLP pipeline, to provide text analytical capabilities at scale in ReDWINE. Using this comprehensive representation of patient data in ReDWINE for rehabilitation research will facilitate real-world evidence for health interventions and outcomes.",ReDWINE: A clinical datamart with text analytical capabilities to facilitate rehabilitation research.,"['Humans', '*Rehabilitation Research', 'Electronic Health Records', '*Medical Informatics', 'Natural Language Processing']",,

The risk of hyponatremia resulting from combination oral tramadol/acetaminophen (TA) therapy is thus unknown. This study examined whether, compared with acetaminophen (AA), TA use is associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia. METHODS: Hospital data compatible with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM; version 5.3) for 30,999 patients taking TA or AA from 2011 through 2020 were analyzed. New-onset hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level < 135 mEq/L within 10 days after drug initiation. The incidence rate ratio was calculated based on crude and 1:1 propensity-score-matched models. Subgroup analyses compared patients taking TA extended-release (TA-ER) and TA immediate-release (TA-IR) formulations. RESULTS: Among the 30,999 patients, 12,122 (39.1%) were aged > 65 years and 16,654 (53.7%) were male. Hyponatremia within 10 days developed in 1613 (8.4%) of the 19,149 patients in the TA group; the incidence rate was higher than in the AA group (4.2%; 493 out of 11,850 cases). In the propensity-score-matched model, the incidence rate of hyponatremia in the TA group was 6.8 per 1000 person-days (PD), which was 1.57-fold (1.31, 1.89) higher than that in the AA group (4.3 per 1000 PD). In both the crude and propensity-score-matched models, the incidence rate of hyponatremia was significantly higher in the TA-ER than TA-IR subgroup. CONCLUSION: In this real-world study, hyponatremia was more frequently observed in the TA than AA group, and in the TA-ER than TA-IR subgroup. Therefore, it is imperative to prescribe tramadol cautiously and closely monitor electrolyte levels.",Risk of Hyponatremia after Tramadol/Acetaminophen Single-Pill Combination Therapy: A Real-World Study Based on the OMOP-CDM Database.,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Acetaminophen/adverse effects', '*Hyponatremia/chemically induced/epidemiology/drug therapy', 'Incidence', '*Tramadol/adverse effects', 'Aged']",,

CDMs unite data from disparate sources and ease collaborations across institutions, resulting in the generation of large standardized data repositories across different entities. An overview of existing CDMs and methods used to develop these data sets may assist in the development process of future models for the health domain, such as for decision support systems. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review investigates methods used in the development of CDMs for health data. We aim to provide a broad overview of approaches and guidelines that are used in the development of CDMs (ie, common data elements or common data sets) for different health domains on an international level. METHODS: This scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We conducted the literature search in prominent databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus, starting from January 2000 until March 2022. We identified and screened 1309 articles. The included articles were evaluated based on the type of adopted method, which was used in the conception, users' needs collection, implementation, and evaluation phases of CDMs, and whether stakeholders (such as medical experts, patients' representatives, and IT staff) were involved during the process. Moreover, the models were grouped into iterative or linear types based on the imperativeness of the stages during development. RESULTS: We finally identified 59 articles that fit our eligibility criteria. Of these articles, 45 specifically focused on common medical conditions, 10 focused on rare medical conditions, and the remaining 4 focused on both conditions. The development process usually involved stakeholders but in different ways (eg, working group meetings, Delphi approaches, interviews, and questionnaires). Twenty-two models followed an iterative process. CONCLUSIONS: The included articles showed the diversity of methods used to develop a CDM in different domains of health.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fed-Pade, motivated by a classic mathematical tool, Pade approximants, reconstructs the multi-site data likelihood via Pade approximant whose key parameters can be computed distributively. Thanks to the simplicity of [2,2] Pade approximant, Fed-Pade requests an extremely simple task and low communication cost for data partners. Specifically, each data partner only needs to compute and share the log-likelihood and its first 4 gradients evaluated at an initial estimator. We evaluated the performance of our algorithm with extensive simulation studies and four observational healthcare databases. RESULTS: Our simulation studies revealed that a [2,2]-Pade approximant can well reconstruct the multi-site likelihood so that Fed-Pade produces nearly identical estimates to the pooled analysis. Across all simulation scenarios considered, the median of relative bias and rate of instability of our Fed-Pade are both <0.1%, whereas meta-analysis estimates have bias up to 50% and instability up to 75%. Furthermore, the confidence intervals derived from the Fed-Pade algorithm showed better coverage of the truth than confidence intervals based on the meta-analysis. In real data analysis, the Fed-Pade has a relative bias of <1% for all three comparisons for risks of acute liver injury and decreased libido, whereas the meta-analysis estimates have a substantially higher bias (around 10%). CONCLUSION: The Fed-Pade algorithm is nearly lossless, stable, communication-efficient, and easy to implement for models with rare outcomes. It provides an extremely suitable and convenient approach for synthesizing evidence in distributed research networks with rare outcomes.","Pade approximant meets federated learning: A nearly lossless, one-shot algorithm for evidence synthesis in distributed research networks with rare outcomes.","['*Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', '*Machine Learning']",,

However, it is recommended to minimize the duration of oral antibiotic use, and there is increasing support for other systemic agents for acne. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the use of oral antibiotics and isotretinoin for the treatment of acne in the pediatric and young adult population aged 10 through 20 years and the adult population aged 21 to 45 years from 2011 to 2019. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study using electronic data from the enterprise data warehouse of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and its affiliates, with data in the format of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model. Categorical values (sex, race, and ethnicity) were compared using chi-square tests, and continuous variables (age) were compared using 2-tailed t tests. RESULTS: Our cohort of 15,704 patients was composed of mostly White (12,776/15,704, 81.4%), non-Hispanic or Latino (13,307/15,704, 84.7%), and female (11,093/15,704, 70.6%) patients. Among the 4605 male patients in the eligible cohort, 1810 (39%) received an oral antibiotic treatment, in comparison to 3109 (28%) of the 11,093 eligible women (P<.001). Among the 4605 men who were eligible for treatment with isotretinoin in this population, 988 (21.5%) received a course of isotretinoin, compared to only 10.4% (1159/11,093) eligible women (P<.001). Male patients were 1.67 times more likely to have received an antibiotic prescription (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% CI 1.55-1.79) and over twice as likely to have received an isotretinoin prescription (OR 2.34, 95% CI 2.13-2.57) than female patients. CONCLUSIONS: Minocycline was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic for the treatment of acne in this study cohort. From 2015 to 2019, there was no significant change in the number of antibiotic prescriptions over time. Men were significantly more likely to receive both oral antibiotics and isotretinoin than female patients. Multiple factors could be contributing to this discrepancy, including the burden of iPLEDGE, additional systemic treatment options for female patients, and the difference in acne severity across sexes. We could not determine the difference in severity of acne between male and female patients in our cohort, and further research is needed to ascertain the variation across sexes.",Prescribing Patterns of Oral Antibiotics and Isotretinoin for Acne in a Colorado Hospital System: Retrospective Cohort Study.,,,

We conducted a large, retrospective study to investigate the survival impact of cardiovascular co-medications in patients with liver cirrhosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study-specific R package was processed on the local databases of partner institutions within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics consortium, namely Columbia University, New York City (NYC), USA and Ajou University School of Medicine (AUSOM), South Korea. Patients with cirrhosis diagnosed between 2000 and 2020 were included. Final analysis of the anonymous survival data was performed at Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University. RESULTS: We investigated a total of 32,366 patients with liver cirrhosis. Our data showed that administration of antiarrhythmics amiodarone or digoxin presented as a negative prognostic indicator (p = 0.000 in both cohorts). Improved survival was associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril (p = 0.005 in NYC cohort, p = 0.075 in AUSOM cohort) and angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan (p = 0.000 in NYC cohort, p = 0.005 in AUSOM cohort). Non-selective beta blocker carvedilol was associated with a survival advantage in the NYC (p = 0.000) cohort but not in the AUSOM cohort (p = 0.142). Patients who took platelet inhibitor clopidogrel had a prolonged overall survival compared to those without (p = 0.000 in NYC cohort, p = 0.003 in AUSOM cohort). CONCLUSION: Concomitant cardiovascular medications are associated with distinct survival difference in cirrhotic patients. Multidisciplinary management is needed for a judicious choice of proper cardiovascular co-medications in cirrhotic patients.",Impact of concomitant cardiovascular medications on overall survival in patients with liver cirrhosis.,"['Humans', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Liver Cirrhosis/complications', '*Losartan', 'Comorbidity', 'Carvedilol']",,

Currently, OMOP CDM is populated with German Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) using an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process, which was designed as a bulk load. However, the computational effort that comes with an everyday full load is not efficient for daily recruitment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to extend our existing ETL process with the option of incremental loading to efficiently support daily updated data. METHODS: Based on our existing bulk ETL process, we performed an analysis to determine the requirements of incremental loading. Furthermore, a literature review was conducted to identify adaptable approaches. Based on this, we implemented three methods to integrate incremental loading into our ETL process. Lastly, a test suite was defined to evaluate the incremental loading for data correctness and performance compared to bulk loading. RESULTS: The resulting ETL process supports bulk and incremental loading. Performance tests show that the incremental load took 87.5% less execution time than the bulk load (2.12 min compared to 17.07 min) related to changes of 1 day, while no data differences occurred in OMOP CDM. CONCLUSIONS: Since incremental loading is more efficient than a daily bulk load and both loading options result in the same amount of data, we recommend using bulk load for an initial load and switching to incremental load for daily updates. The resulting incremental ETL logic can be applied internationally since it is not restricted to German FHIR profiles.",An Extract-Transform-Load Process Design for the Incremental Loading of German Real-World Data Based on FHIR and OMOP CDM: Algorithm Development and Validation.,,,

Unfortunately, the usage of various documentation software solutions leads to semantic and technical heterogeneity of the data, complicating the establishment of research networks and collective data analysis. Within this feasibility study, we evaluated the transferability of all oBDS characteristics to the standardized vocabularies, a metadata repository of the observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM).

Observational databases provide opportunities to study the epidemiology of HS. OBJECTIVE: This study's objective was to develop phenotype algorithms for HS suitable for epidemiological studies based on a network of observational databases. METHODS: A data-driven approach was used to develop 4 HS algorithms. A literature search identified prior HS algorithms. Standardized databases from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (n=9) were used to develop 2 incident and 2 prevalent HS phenotype algorithms. Two open-source diagnostic tools, CohortDiagnostics and PheValuator, were used to evaluate and generate phenotype performance metric estimates, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value. RESULTS: We developed 2 prevalent and 2 incident HS algorithms. Validation showed that PPV estimates were highest (mean 86%) for the prevalent HS algorithm requiring at least two HS diagnosis codes. Sensitivity estimates were highest (mean 58%) for the prevalent HS algorithm requiring at least one HS code. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the evaluation process and provides performance metrics for 2 incident and 2 prevalent HS algorithms across 9 observational databases.

Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, improves AD via inhibition of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to characterize the prescribing patterns of dupilumab for AD in adults at a large university-affiliated health system. METHODS: A retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted using electronic data from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics database, assessing data from the University of Colorado Medical Campus and its affiliates. The outcome measured was the prevalence of dupilumab prescribed for adults with AD (n=6421), between March 28, 2013, and March 28, 2021. We assessed whether the characteristics of patients who received dupilumab were different from those who did not. Each patient characteristic was assessed using a univariate logistic regression with the binary outcome of receiving or not receiving dupilumab. RESULTS: We found a population prevalence of 5.6% (6421/114,476) for AD. In our cohort, Black patients with AD were more than twice as likely to have received dupilumab compared to White patients (odds ratio 2.352, 95% CI 1.58-3.39). Patients with a diagnosis of atopic neurodermatitis were approximately twice as likely to have received dupilumab compared to those with other diagnostic variants of AD (odds ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.01-3.22).

Manually annotating data element names to internationally standardized data element identifiers is a time-consuming effort. Tools can support performing this task automatically. This study aimed to determine what factors influence the quality of automatic annotations. METHODS: Data element names were used from the Dutch COVID-19 ICU Data Warehouse containing data on intensive care patients with COVID-19 from 25 hospitals in the Netherlands. In this data warehouse, the data had been merged using a proprietary terminology system while also storing the original hospital labels (synonymous names). Usagi, an OHDSI annotation tool, was used to perform the annotation for the data. A gold standard was used to determine if Usagi made correct annotations. Logistic regression was used to determine if the number of characters, number of words, match score (Usagi's certainty) and hospital label origin influenced Usagi's performance to annotate correctly. RESULTS: Usagi automatically annotated 30.5% of the data element names correctly and 5.5% of the synonymous names. The match score is the best predictor for Usagi finding the correct annotation. It was determined that the AUC of data element names was 0.651 and 0.752 for the synonymous names respectively. The AUC for the individual hospital label origins varied between 0.460 to 0.905. DISCUSSION: The results show that Usagi performed better to annotate the data element names than the synonymous names. The hospital origin in the synonymous names dataset was associated with the amount of correctly annotated concepts. Hospitals that performed better had shorter synonymous names and fewer words. Using shorter data element names or synonymous names should be considered to optimize the automatic annotating process. Overall, the performance of Usagi is too poor to completely rely on for automatic annotation.",Determining and assessing characteristics of data element names impacting the performance of annotation using Usagi.,"['Humans', '*COVID-19/epidemiology', 'Netherlands']",,

METHODS: Based on MetaLAB, we created an optimal scenario for detecting ADRs by considering demographic and clinical records. MetaLAB-HOI was developed to identify ADR signals using common model-based multicenter electronic health record (EHR) data from the clinical health outcomes of interest (HOI) template and design for drug-exposed and nonexposed groups. In this study, we calculated the odds ratio of 101 drugs for HOI in Konyang University Hospital, Seoul National University Hospital, Chungbuk National University Hospital, and Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. RESULTS: The overlapping drugs in four medical centers are amlodipine, aspirin, bisoprolol, carvedilol, clopidogrel, clozapine, digoxin, diltiazem, methotrexate, and rosuvastatin. We developed MetaLAB-HOI, an algorithm that can detect ADRs more efficiently using EHR. We compared the detection results of four medical centers, with drug-induced liver injuries as representative ADRs. CONCLUSIONS: MetaLAB-HOI's strength lies in fully utilizing the patient's clinical information, such as prescription, procedure, and laboratory results, to detect ADR signals.

Our second aim was to provide a descriptive analysis of COVID-19-related outcomes among the general population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We mapped patient-level data from SIDIAP to the OMOP CDM and we performed more than 3,400 data quality checks to assess its readiness for research. We established a general population cohort as of the 1st March 2020 and identified outpatient COVID-19 diagnoses or tested positive for, hospitalised with, admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with, died with, or vaccinated against COVID-19 up to 30th June 2022. RESULTS: After verifying the high quality of the transformed dataset, we included 5,870,274 individuals in the general population cohort. Of those, 604,472 had either an outpatient COVID-19 diagnosis or positive test result, 58,991 had a hospitalisation, 5,642 had an ICU admission, and 11,233 died with COVID-19. A total of 4,584,515 received a COVID-19 vaccine. People who were hospitalised or died were more commonly older, male, and with more comorbidities. Those admitted to ICU with COVID-19 were generally younger and more often male than those hospitalised and those who died. CONCLUSION: We successfully transformed SIDIAP to the OMOP CDM. From this dataset, a general population cohort of 5.9 million individuals was identified and their COVID-19-related outcomes over time were described. The transformed SIDIAP database is a valuable resource that can enable distributed network research in COVID-19 and beyond.",Transforming the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) in Catalonia to the OMOP Common Data Model and Its Use for COVID-19 Research.,,,

This study aimed to generate a systematic framework based on data from electronic health records (EHRs) to assess patients with ATTR-CM in a real-world population of heart failure (HF) patients. Predictive factors or combinations of predictive factors related to ATTR-CM in a European population were also assessed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective unstructured and semi-structured data from EHRs of patients from OLV Hospital Aalst, Belgium (2012-20), were processed using natural language processing (NLP) to generate an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model database. NLP model performance was assessed on a random subset of EHRs by comparing algorithm outputs to a physician-generated standard (using precision, recall, and their harmonic mean, or F1-score). Of the 3127 HF patients, 103 potentially had ATTR-CM (age 78 +/- 9 years; male 55%; ejection fraction of 48% +/- 16). The mean diagnostic delay between HF and ATTR-CM diagnosis was 1.8 years. Besides HF and cardiomyopathy-related phenotypes, the strongest cardiac predictor was atrial fibrillation (AF; 72% in ATTR-CM vs. 60% in non-ATTR-CM, P = 0.02), whereas the strongest non-cardiac predictor was carpal tunnel syndrome (21% in ATTR-CM vs. 3% in non-ATTR-CM, P < 0.001). The strongest combination predictor was AF, joint disorders, and HF with preserved ejection fraction (29% in ATTR-CM vs. 18% in non-ATTR-CM: odds ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval = 1.28-3.22). CONCLUSIONS: Not only well-known variables associated with ATTR-CM but also unique combinations of cardiac and non-cardiac phenotypes are able to predict ATTR-CM in a real-world HF population, aiding in early identification of ATTR-CM patients.",Detection of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy by automated data extraction from electronic health records.,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial/diagnosis/epidemiology/complications', '*Cardiomyopathies/diagnosis/epidemiology/complications', 'Delayed Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Records', '*Heart Failure/diagnosis/epidemiology/complications', 'Prealbumin/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Female']",,

Little is known about the persistence of self-reported and performance-based cognition with depression and functional outcomes. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective naturalistic observational clinical cohort study of individuals with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD; N = 623). Participants completed app-based self-reported and performance-based cognitive function assessments alongside validated measures of depression, functional disability, and self-esteem every 3 months. Participants were followed-up for a maximum of 2-years. Multilevel hierarchically nested modelling was employed to explore between- and within-participant variation over time to identify whether persistent cognitive difficulties are related to levels of depression and functional impairment during follow-up. RESULTS: 508 individuals (81.5%) provided data (mean age: 46.6, s.d.: 15.6; 76.2% female). Increasing persistence of self-reported cognitive difficulty was associated with higher levels of depression and functional impairment throughout the follow-up. In comparison to low persistence of objective cognitive difficulty (<25% of timepoints), those with high persistence (>75% of timepoints) reported significantly higher levels of depression (B = 5.17, s.e. = 2.21, p = 0.019) and functional impairment (B = 4.82, s.e. = 1.79, p = 0.002) over time. Examination of the individual cognitive modules shows that persistently impaired executive function is associated with worse functioning, and poor processing speed is particularly important for worsened depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: We replicated previous findings of greater persistence of cognitive difficulty with increasing severity of depression and further demonstrate that these cognitive difficulties are associated with pervasive functional disability. Difficulties with cognition may be an indicator and target for further treatment input.",The association between persistent cognitive difficulties and depression and functional outcomes in people with major depressive disorder.,"['Humans', 'Female', 'Middle Aged', 'Male', '*Depressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Depression', 'Prospective Studies', 'Cognition']",,

We investigated whether concomitant PPI use influenced the risk of recurrence in patients with stroke and myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: This study used two databases for two different designs, the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database for a self-controlled case series design, and the national sample cohort of the NHIS data base converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model version for a cohort study based on large-scale propensity score matching. RESULTS: In the PPI co-prescription group, recurrent hospitalization with stroke occurred in 17.6% of the 8201 patients with history of stroke, and recurrent MI occurred in 17.1% of the 1216 patients with history of MI within1 year. According to the self-controlled case series, the overall relative risk (RR) of recurrent stroke was 2.09 (95% confidence interval (CI); 1.83-2.38); the RR showed an increasing trend parallel to the time from the beginning of PPI co-prescription. In the cohort study, there was a higher incidence of recurrent stroke in the PPI co-prescription group (Hazard ratio (HR): 1.34, 95% CI: 1.01-1.76, p = 0.04). The overall RR of recurrent MI was 1.47 (95% CI; 1.02-2.11) in the self-controlled case series; however, there was no statistically significant difference in recurrent MI in the cohort study (HR:1.42, 95% CI:0.79-2.49, p = 0.23). The impact of individual PPIs on stroke and MI showed different patterns. CONCLUSIONS: A PPI co-prescription >4 weeks with clopidogrel was associated with hospitalization of recurrent stroke within 1 year of initial diagnosis; however, its association with recurrent MI remains inconclusive.

This dataset aims to facilitate generalizability studies of machine learning models, as well as statistical studies of clinical practices in the intensive care units. METHODS: Four publicly available and patient-level intensive care databases were used as source databases. A unique and customizable preprocessing pipeline extracted clinically relevant patient-related variables from each source database. The variables were then harmonized and standardized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Format. Finally, a brief comparison was carried out to explore differences in the source databases. RESULTS: The BlendedICU dataset features 41 timeseries variables as well as the exposure times to 113 active ingredients extracted from the AmsterdamUMCdb, eICU, HiRID, and MIMIC-IV databases. This resulted in a database of more than 309000 intensive care admissions, spanning over 13 years and three countries. We found that data collection, drug exposure, and patient outcomes varied strongly between source databases. CONCLUSION: The variability in data collection, drug exposure, and patient outcomes between the source databases indicated some dissimilarity in patient phenotypes and clinical practices between different intensive care units.

Common Data Models (CDMs) can help consolidate health data repositories from different institutions minimizing loss of meaning by organizing data into a standard structure. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM, Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) and International Cancer Genome Consortium, Accelerating Research in Genomic Oncology (ICGC ARGO) for representing non-imaging data in a breast cancer use case of EuCanImage. METHODS: We used ontologies to represent metamodels of OMOP, i2b2, and ICGC ARGO and variables used in a cancer use case of a European AI project. We selected four evaluation criteria for the CDMs adapted from previous research: content coverage, simplicity, integration, implementability. RESULTS: i2b2 and OMOP exhibited higher element completeness (100% each) than ICGC ARGO (58.1%), while the three achieved 100% domain completeness. ICGC ARGO normalizes only one of our variables with a standard terminology, while i2b2 and OMOP use standardized vocabularies for all of them. In terms of simplicity, ICGC ARGO and i2b2 proved to be simpler both in terms of ontological model (276 and 175 elements, respectively) and in the queries (7 and 20 lines of code, respectively), while OMOP required a much more complex ontological model (615 elements) and queries similar to those of i2b2 (20 lines). Regarding implementability, OMOP had the highest number of mentions in articles in PubMed (130) and Google Scholar (1,810), ICGC ARGO had the highest number of updates to the CDM since 2020 (4), and i2b2 is the model with more tools specifically developed for the CDM (26). CONCLUSION: ICGC ARGO proved to be rigid and very limited in the representation of oncologic concepts, while i2b2 and OMOP showed a very good performance. i2b2's lack of a common dictionary hinders its scalability, requiring sites that will share data to explicitly define a conceptual framework, and suggesting that OMOP and its Oncology extension could be the more suitable choice.

Methods: Individuals exposed to bumetanide or furosemide were identified in the Stanford University electronic health record using the de-identified Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership platform. We matched the AD case cohort to a control cohort (1:20 case:control) on gender, race, ethnicity, and hypertension, and controlled for variables that could potentially be collinear with bumetanide exposure and/or AD diagnosis. Among individuals older than 65 years, 5,839 AD cases and 116,103 matched controls were included. A total of 1,759 patients (54 cases and 1,705 controls) were exposed to bumetanide. Results: After adjusting for socioeconomic status and other confounders, the exposure of bumetanide and furosemide was significantly associated with reduced AD risk (respectively, bumetanide odds ratio [OR] = 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.36; p = 4.0 x 10(-11); furosemide OR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.38-0.47; p < 2.0 x 10(-16)). Discussion: Our study replicates in an independent sample that a history of bumetanide exposure is associated with reduced AD risk while also highlighting an association of the most common loop diuretic (furosemide) with reduced AD risk. These associations need to be additionally replicated, and the mechanism of action remains to be investigated.",Loop diuretics association with Alzheimer's disease risk.,,,

diabetes mellitus who are receiving metformin. DESIGN: Federated pharmacoepidemiological evaluation in LEGEND-T2DM. SETTING: 10 US and seven non-US electronic health record and administrative claims databases in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network in eight countries from 2011 to the end of 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 4.8 million patients (>/=18 years) across US and non-US based databases with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had received metformin monotherapy and had initiated second line treatments. EXPOSURE: The exposure used to evaluate each database was calendar year trends, with the years in the study that were specific to each cohort. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The outcome was the incidence of second line antihyperglycaemic drug use (ie, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sulfonylureas) among individuals who were already receiving treatment with metformin. The relative drug class level uptake across cardiovascular risk groups was also evaluated. RESULTS: 4.6 million patients were identified in US databases, 61 382 from Spain, 32 442 from Germany, 25 173 from the UK, 13 270 from France, 5580 from Scotland, 4614 from Hong Kong, and 2322 from Australia. During 2011-21, the combined proportional initiation of the cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) increased across all data sources, with the combined initiation of these drugs as second line drugs in 2021 ranging from 35.2% to 68.2% in the US databases, 15.4% in France, 34.7% in Spain, 50.1% in Germany, and 54.8% in Scotland. From 2016 to 2021, in some US and non-US databases, uptake of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors increased more significantly among populations with no cardiovascular disease compared with patients with established cardiovascular disease. No data source provided evidence of a greater increase in the uptake of these two drug classes in populations with cardiovascular disease compared with no cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increase in overall uptake of cardioprotective antihyperglycaemic drugs as second line treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus, their uptake was lower in patients with cardiovascular disease than in people with no cardiovascular disease over the past decade. A strategy is needed to ensure that medication use is concordant with guideline recommendations to improve outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Multinational patterns of second line antihyperglycaemic drug initiation across cardiovascular risk groups: federated pharmacoepidemiological evaluation in LEGEND-T2DM.,,,

They help healthcare providers to monitor the quality and safety of care delivered and to identify areas for improvement. Clinical quality indicators, therefore, need to be based on real world data. Generating reliable and actionable data routinely is challenging. Healthcare data are often stored in different formats and use different terminologies and coding systems, making it difficult to generate and compare indicator reports from different sources. METHODS: The Observational Health Sciences and Informatics community maintains the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP). This is an open data standard providing a computable and interoperable format for real world data. We implemented a Computable Biomedical Knowledge Object (CBK) in the Piano Platform based on OMOP. The CBK calculates an inpatient quality indicator and was illustrated using synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data in the open OMOP standard. RESULTS: The CBK reported the in-hospital mortality of patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for the synthetic EHR dataset and includes interactive visualizations and the results of calculations. Value sets composed of OMOP concept codes for AMI and comorbidities used in the indicator calculation were also created. CONCLUSION: Computable biomedical knowledge (CBK) objects that operate on OMOP data can be reused across datasets that conform to OMOP. With OMOP being a widely used interoperability standard, quality indicators embedded in CBKs can accelerate the generation of evidence for targeted quality and safety management, improving care to benefit larger populations.",A computable biomedical knowledge object for calculating in-hospital mortality for patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction.,,,

We aimed to develop a well-tested and user-friendly R package to compute incidence rates and prevalence in data mapped to the observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created IncidencePrevalence, an R package to support the analysis of population-level incidence rates and point- and period-prevalence in OMOP-formatted data. On top of unit testing, we assessed the face validity of the package. To do so, we calculated incidence rates of COVID-19 using RWD from Spain (SIDIAP) and the United Kingdom (CPRD Aurum), and replicated two previously published studies using data from the Netherlands (IPCI) and the United Kingdom (CPRD Gold). We compared the obtained results to those previously published, and measured execution times by running a benchmark analysis across databases. RESULTS: IncidencePrevalence achieved high agreement to previously published data in CPRD Gold and IPCI, and showed good performance across databases. For COVID-19, incidence calculated by the package was similar to public data after the first-wave of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: For data mapped to the OMOP CDM, the IncidencePrevalence R package can support descriptive epidemiological research. It enables reliable estimation of incidence and prevalence from large real-world data sets. It represents a simple, but extendable, analytical framework to generate estimates in a reproducible and timely manner.",IncidencePrevalence: An R package to calculate population-level incidence rates and prevalence using the OMOP common data model.,"['Humans', 'Incidence', 'Prevalence', '*Data Management', 'Databases, Factual', '*COVID-19/epidemiology']",,

However, the diversity of different vocabularies across health care institutions and countries is a barrier to achieving semantic interoperability and exchanging data across sites. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) enables the standardization of structure and medical terminology. It allows the mapping of national vocabularies into so-called standard concepts, representing normative expressions for international analyses and research. Within our project ""Hybrid Quality Indicators Using Machine Learning Methods"" (Hybrid-QI), we aim to harmonize source codes used in German claims data vocabularies that are currently unavailable in the OMOP CDM. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to increase the coverage of German vocabularies in the OMOP CDM. We aim to completely transform the source codes used in German claims data into the OMOP CDM without data loss and make German claims data usable for OMOP CDM-based research. METHODS: To prepare the missing German vocabularies for the OMOP CDM, we defined a vocabulary preparation approach consisting of the identification of all codes of the corresponding vocabularies, their assembly into machine-readable tables, and the translation of German designations into English. Furthermore, we used 2 proposed approaches for OMOP-compliant vocabulary preparation: the mapping to standard concepts using the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) tool Usagi and the preparation of new 2-billion concepts (ie, concept_id >2 billion). Finally, we evaluated the prepared vocabularies regarding completeness and correctness using synthetic German claims data and calculated the coverage of German claims data vocabularies in the OMOP CDM. RESULTS: Our vocabulary preparation approach was able to map 3 missing German vocabularies to standard concepts and prepare 8 vocabularies as new 2-billion concepts. The completeness evaluation showed that the prepared vocabularies cover 44.3% (3288/7417) of the source codes contained in German claims data. The correctness evaluation revealed that the specified validity periods in the OMOP CDM are compliant for the majority (705,531/706,032, 99.9%) of source codes and associated dates in German claims data. The calculation of the vocabulary coverage showed a noticeable decrease of missing vocabularies from 55% (11/20) to 10% (2/20) due to our preparation approach. CONCLUSIONS: By preparing 10 vocabularies, we showed that our approach is applicable to any type of vocabulary used in a source data set.

This study examines the factors that make standardizing observational health data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM successful. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five data partners (DPs) from 11 countries received funding from the European Health Data Evidence Network (EHDEN) to standardize their data. Three surveys, DataQualityDashboard results, and statistics from the conversion process were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Our measures of success were the total number of days to transform source data into the OMOP CDM and participation in network research. RESULTS: The health data converted to CDM represented more than 133 million patients. 100%, 88%, and 84% of DPs took Surveys 1, 2, and 3. The median duration of the 6 key extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes ranged from 4 to 115 days. Of the 25 DPs, 21 DPs were considered applicable for analysis of which 52% standardized their data on time, and 48% participated in an international collaborative study. DISCUSSION: This study shows that the consistent workflow used by EHDEN proves appropriate to support the successful standardization of observational data across Europe. Over the 25 successful transformations, we confirmed that getting the right people for the ETL is critical and vocabulary mapping requires specific expertise and support of tools. Additionally, we learned that teams that proactively prepared for data governance issues were able to avoid considerable delays improving their ability to finish on time. CONCLUSION: This study provides guidance for future DPs to standardize to the OMOP CDM and participate in distributed networks. We demonstrate that the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics community must continue to evaluate and provide guidance and support for what ultimately develops the backbone of how community members generate evidence.",European Health Data & Evidence Network-learnings from building out a standardized international health data network.,"['Humans', '*Global Health', 'Databases, Factual', 'Europe', '*Medicine', 'Electronic Health Records']",,

Numerous risk stratification tools exist, but effort and manpower are required. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a predictive model of postoperative adverse outcomes in older patients following general surgery with an open-source, patient-level prediction from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics for internal and external validation. METHODS: We used the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model and machine learning algorithms. The primary outcome was a composite of 90-day postoperative all-cause mortality and emergency department visits. Secondary outcomes were postoperative delirium, prolonged postoperative stay (>/=75th percentile), and prolonged hospital stay (>/=21 days). An 80% versus 20% split of the data from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) and Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) common data model was used for model training and testing versus external validation. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with a 95% CI. RESULTS: Data from 27,197 (SNUBH) and 32,857 (SNUH) patients were analyzed. Compared to the random forest, Adaboost, and decision tree models, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression model showed good internal discriminative accuracy (internal AUC 0.723, 95% CI 0.701-0.744) and transportability (external AUC 0.703, 95% CI 0.692-0.714) for the primary outcome. The model also possessed good internal and external AUCs for postoperative delirium (internal AUC 0.754, 95% CI 0.713-0.794; external AUC 0.750, 95% CI 0.727-0.772), prolonged postoperative stay (internal AUC 0.813, 95% CI 0.800-0.825; external AUC 0.747, 95% CI 0.741-0.753), and prolonged hospital stay (internal AUC 0.770, 95% CI 0.749-0.792; external AUC 0.707, 95% CI 0.696-0.718). Compared with age or the Charlson comorbidity index, the model showed better prediction performance.

Among the 9,473,551 eligible patients, we identified 4669 patients with HNC, of whom 398 were included in the target cohort, and 4271 were included in the control cohort after propensity score matching. A Cox proportional regression model was used. Of the 4669 patients included, 398 (8.52%) previously received statin prescriptions. Statin use was associated with a reduced rate of 3- and 5-year HNC recurrence compared to propensity score-matched controls (risk ratio [RR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.03; and RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.70-1.12, respectively). Nevertheless, the association between statin use and HNC recurrence was not statistically significant. A meta-analysis of recurrence based on subgroups, including age subgroups, showed similar trends. The results of this propensity-matched cohort study may not provide a statistically significant association between statin use and a lower risk of HNC recurrence.

Typically relying on sequential analysis of real-world health data as they accrue, safety surveillance is challenged by sequential multiple testing and by biases induced by residual confounding in observational data. The current standard approach based on the maximized sequential probability ratio test (MaxSPRT) fails to satisfactorily address these practical challenges and it remains a rigid framework that requires prespecification of the surveillance schedule. We develop an alternative Bayesian surveillance procedure that addresses both aforementioned challenges using a more flexible framework. To mitigate bias, we jointly analyze a large set of negative control outcomes that are adverse events with no known association with the vaccines in order to inform an empirical bias distribution, which we then incorporate into estimating the effect of vaccine exposure on the adverse event of interest through a Bayesian hierarchical model. To address multiple testing and improve on flexibility, at each analysis timepoint, we update a posterior probability in favor of the alternative hypothesis that vaccination induces higher risks of adverse events, and then use it for sequential detection of safety signals. Through an empirical evaluation using six US observational healthcare databases covering more than 360 million patients, we benchmark the proposed procedure against MaxSPRT on testing errors and estimation accuracy, under two epidemiological designs, the historical comparator and the self-controlled case series. We demonstrate that our procedure substantially reduces Type 1 error rates, maintains high statistical power and fast signal detection, and provides considerably more accurate estimation than MaxSPRT. Given the extensiveness of the empirical study which yields more than 7 million sets of results, we present all results in a public R ShinyApp. As an effort to promote open science, we provide full implementation of our method in the open-source R package EvidenceSynthesis.",Bayesian safety surveillance with adaptive bias correction.,"['Humans', '*Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Bias', 'Probability', '*Vaccines/adverse effects', '*Product Surveillance, Postmarketing']",,

DESIGN: Study of data elements. PARTICIPANTS: Not applicable. METHODS: Data elements (field names and predefined entry values) from the general eye examination in the Epic foundation system were mapped to OMOP concepts and analyzed. Each mapping was given a Health Level 7 equivalence designation-equal when the OMOP concept had the same meaning as the source EHR concept, wider when it was missing information, narrower when it was overly specific, and unmatched when there was no match. Initial mappings were reviewed by 2 graders. Intergrader agreement for equivalence designation was calculated using Cohen's kappa. Agreement on the mapped OMOP concept was calculated as a percentage of total mappable concepts. Discrepancies were discussed and a final consensus created. Quantitative analysis was performed on wider and unmatched concepts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gaps in OMOP concept coverage of EHR elements and intergrader agreement of mapped OMOP concepts. RESULTS: A total of 698 data elements (210 fields, 488 values) from the EHR were analyzed. The intergrader kappa on the equivalence designation was 0.88 (standard error 0.03, P < 0.001). There was a 96% agreement on the mapped OMOP concept. In the final consensus mapping, 25% (1% fields, 31% values) of the EHR to OMOP concept mappings were considered equal, 50% (27% fields, 60% values) wider, 4% (8% fields, 2% values) narrower, and 21% (52% fields, 8% values) unmatched. Of the wider mapped elements, 46% were missing the laterality specification, 24% had other missing attributes, and 30% had both issues. Wider and unmatched EHR elements could be found in all areas of the general eye examination. CONCLUSIONS: Most data elements in the general eye examination could not be represented precisely using the OMOP CDM. Our work suggests multiple ways to improve the incorporation of important ophthalmology concepts in OMOP, including adding laterality to existing concepts. There exists a strong need to improve the coverage of ophthalmic concepts in source vocabularies so that the OMOP CDM can better accommodate vision research.

Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and osteoporosis are representative senile diseases. Various studies have reported that AD and osteoporosis share many risk factors that affect each other's incidence. This aimed to determine if active medication treatment of AD could affect the development of osteoporosis. METHODS: The Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service provided data consisting of diagnosis, demographics, prescription drug, procedures, medical materials, and healthcare resources. In this study, data of all AD patients in South Korea who were registered under the national health insurance system were obtained. The cohort underwent conversion to an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model version 5 format. RESULTS: This study included 11,355 individuals in the good persistent group and an equal number of 11,355 individuals in the poor persistent group from the National Health Claims database for AD drug treatment. In primary analysis, the risk of osteoporosis was significantly higher in the poor persistence group than in the good persistence group (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.32]; p<0.001).

METHODS: We used Microsoft Azure as the cloud service provider and named this effort the SickKids Enterprise-wide Data in Azure Repository (SEDAR). Epic Clarity data from on-premises was copied to a virtual network in Microsoft Azure. Three sequential schemas were developed. The Filtered Schema added a filter to retain only SickKids and valid patients. The Curated Schema created a data structure that was easier to navigate and query. Each table contained a logical unit such as patients, hospital encounters or laboratory tests. Data validation of randomly sampled observations in the Curated Schema was performed. The SK-OMOP Schema was designed to facilitate research and machine learning. Two individuals mapped medical elements to standard Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) concepts. RESULTS: A copy of Clarity data was transferred to Microsoft Azure and updated each night using log shipping. The Filtered Schema and Curated Schema were implemented as stored procedures and executed each night with incremental updates or full loads. Data validation required up to 16 iterations for each Curated Schema table. OMOP concept mapping achieved at least 80 % coverage for each SK-OMOP table.

phenotype definitions is critical in obtaining reliable and reproducible background rates in safety research. This study aims to illustrate the differences in background incidence rates by comparing definitions for a given outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 16 data sources to systematically generate and evaluate outcomes for 13 adverse events and their overall background rates. We examined the effect of different modifications (inpatient setting, standardization of code set, and code set changes) to the computable phenotype on background incidence rates. RESULTS: Rate ratios (RRs) of the incidence rates from each computable phenotype definition varied across outcomes, with inpatient restriction showing the highest variation from 1 to 11.93. Standardization of code set RRs ranges from 1 to 1.64, and code set changes range from 1 to 2.52. DISCUSSION: The modification that has the highest impact is requiring inpatient place of service, leading to at least a 2-fold higher incidence rate in the base definition. Standardization showed almost no change when using source code variations. The strength of the effect in the inpatient restriction is highly dependent on the outcome. Changing definitions from broad to narrow showed the most variability by age/gender/database across phenotypes and less than a 2-fold increase in rate compared to the base definition. CONCLUSION: Characterization of outcomes across a network of databases yields insights into sensitivity and specificity trade-offs when definitions are altered. Outcomes should be thoroughly evaluated prior to use for background rates for their plausibility for use across a global network.",Evaluating the impact of alternative phenotype definitions on incidence rates across a global data network.,,,

MENDS-on-FHIR examined using Health Language Seven's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7((R)) FHIR((R))) and US Core Implementation Guide (US Core IG) compliant resources derived from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to create a standards-based ETL pipeline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The input data source was a research data warehouse containing clinical and administrative data in OMOP CDM Version 5.3 format. OMOP-to-FHIR transformations, using a unique JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-to-JSON transformation language called Whistle, created FHIR R4 V4.0.1/US Core IG V4.0.0 conformant resources that were stored in a local FHIR server. A REST-based Bulk FHIR $export request extracted FHIR resources to populate a local MENDS database. RESULTS: Eleven OMOP tables were used to create 10 FHIR/US Core compliant resource types. A total of 1.13 trillion resources were extracted and inserted into the MENDS repository. A very low rate of non-compliant resources was observed. DISCUSSION: OMOP-to-FHIR transformation results passed validation with less than a 1% non-compliance rate. These standards-compliant FHIR resources provided standardized data elements required by the MENDS surveillance use case. The Bulk FHIR application programming interface (API) enabled population-level data exchange using interoperable FHIR resources. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformation pipeline creates a FHIR interface for accessing OMOP data.

Use of CDMs allows for quicker understanding of data structure and reuse of existing tools. One CDM is the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM. Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is a data collection program collecting general practitioner data in the UK. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to convert a static copy of CPRD AURUM data into the OMOP CDM and run existing tools on the converted data. METHODS: Two methods were used to convert each CPRD file into the OMOP CDM. The first was direct mapping used when converting CPRD files that had comparable tables in the OMOP CDM. The original names were changed to the OMOP equivalent and source values converted to standardized OMOP concepts. CPRD files: Patient (to OMOP Person), Staff (to Provider), Drug Issue (to Drug Exposure) and Practice (to Care Site) were directly mapped. The second method was indirect where for the CPRD Observation file the domain of each data row was used to assign data to proper OMOP tables or columns done by converting all source values to standard concepts. RESULTS: The OMOP CDM conversion populated 12 tables and 20,240,453,339 rows, with the largest table being the Measurement table (5,202,579,174 data row). Mapping source values to OMOP standard concepts, we found 60.2% (46,413 of 77,149) of source concepts were also standard concepts. The Drug Exposure table had the fewest source values already in the standard form as only 4.7% (1,433 of 30,194) of the source concepts were standard concepts. On a data retention level, only 2.00% of all data rows were excluded as they did not have a clear fit in the developed CDM and were not able to stand alone without additional information which was not present. CONCLUSION: CPRD AURUM was successfully converted into the OMOP CDM with minimal data loss. Existing OHDSI tools were used with the converted data to show efficacy of the converted data. The existence of a standardized version of CPRD AURUM data vastly increases its reusability in future research due to increased understanding and tools available.",Conversion of CPRD AURUM Data into the OMOP Common Data Model.,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used Estonian national health databases that store almost all residents' claims, prescriptions, and EHR records. To develop and demonstrate the transformation process of Estonian health data to OMOP CDM, we used a 10% random sample of the Estonian population (n = 150 824 patients) from 2012 to 2019 (MAITT dataset). For the sample, complete information from all 3 databases was converted to OMOP CDM version 5.3. The validation was performed using open-source tools. RESULTS: In total, we transformed over 100 million entries to standard concepts using standard OMOP vocabularies with the average mapping rate 95%. For conditions, observations, drugs, and measurements, the mapping rate was over 90%. In most cases, SNOMED Clinical Terms were used as the target vocabulary. DISCUSSION: During the transformation process, we encountered several challenges, which are described in detail with concrete examples and solutions. CONCLUSION: For a representative 10% random sample, we successfully transferred complete records from 3 national health databases to OMOP CDM and created a reusable transformation process.

Many common data models (CDMs) and standard vocabularies have appeared in an attempt to offer harmonized access to the available information, with Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM being one of the most prominent ones, allowing the standardization and harmonization of health care information. However, despite its flexibility, still capturing imaging metadata along with the corresponding clinical data continues to pose a challenge. This challenge arises from the absence of a comprehensive standard representation for image-related information and subsequent image curation processes and their interlinkage with the respective clinical information. Successful resolution of this challenge holds the potential to enable imaging and clinical data to become harmonized, quality-checked, annotated, and ready to be used in conjunction, in the development of artificial intelligence models and other data-dependent use cases. METHODS: To address this challenge, we introduce medical imaging (MI)-CDM-an extension of the OMOP-CDM specifically designed for registering medical imaging data and curation-related processes. Our modeling choices were the result of iterative numerous discussions among clinical and AI experts to enable the integration of imaging and clinical data in the context of the ProCAncer-I project, for answering a set of clinical questions across the prostate cancer's continuum. RESULTS: Our MI-CDM extension has been successfully implemented for the use case of prostate cancer for integrating imaging and curation metadata along with clinical information by using the OMOP-CDM and its oncology extension.

The long-term regular use of effective but expensive drugs causes an economic burden for patients with exudative AMD. However, there are no studies on the long-term patient-centered economic burden of exudative AMD after reimbursement of anti-VEGFs. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the patient-centered economic burden of exudative AMD for 2 years, including nonreimbursement and out-of-pocket costs, compared with nonexudative AMD using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the OMOP CDM, which included 2,006,478 patients who visited Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from June 2003 to July 2019. We defined the exudative AMD group as patients aged >50 years with a diagnosis of exudative AMD and a prescription for anti-VEGFs or verteporfin. The control group was defined as patients aged >50 years without a diagnosis of exudative AMD or a prescription for anti-VEGFs or verteporfin. To adjust for selection bias, controls were matched by propensity scores using regularized logistic regression with a Laplace prior. We measured any medical cost occurring in the hospital as the economic burden of exudative AMD during a 2-year follow-up period using 4 categories: total medical cost, reimbursement cost, nonreimbursement cost, and out-of-pocket cost. To estimate the average cost by adjusting the confounding variable and overcoming the positive skewness of costs, we used an exponential conditional model with a generalized linear model. RESULTS: We identified 931 patients with exudative AMD and matched 783 (84.1%) with 2918 patients with nonexudative AMD. In the exponential conditional model, the total medical, reimbursement, nonreimbursement, and out-of-pocket incremental costs were estimated at US $3426, US $3130, US $366, and US $561, respectively, in the first year and US $1829, US $1461, US $373, and US $507, respectively, in the second year. All incremental costs in the exudative AMD group were 1.89 to 4.25 and 3.50 to 5.09 times higher in the first and second year, respectively, than those in the control group (P<.001 in all cases). CONCLUSIONS: Exudative AMD had a significantly greater economic impact (P<.001) for 2 years on reimbursement, nonreimbursement, and out-of-pocket costs than nonexudative AMD after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics using the OMOP CDM. Although economic policies could relieve the economic burden of patients with exudative AMD over time, the out-of-pocket cost of exudative AMD was still higher than that of nonexudative AMD for 2 years. Our findings support the need for expanding reimbursement strategies for patients with exudative AMD given the significant economic burden faced by patients with incurable and fatal diseases both in South Korea and worldwide.",Patient-Centered Economic Burden of Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Retrospective Cohort Study.,"['Humans', '*Financial Stress', '*Macular Degeneration/epidemiology/diagnosis', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Verteporfin', 'Middle Aged']",,

Clinical Trial Recruitment Support Systems are systems that help to increase the number of participants by seeking more suitable subjects. The software ATLAS (developed by Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) can support the launch of a clinical trial by building cohorts of patients who fulfill certain criteria. The correct use of medical classification systems aiming at clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria in the studies is an important pillar of this software. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether ATLAS can be used in a Clinical Trial Recruitment Support System to portray the eligibility criteria of clinical studies. Our analysis considered the number of criteria feasible for integration with ATLAS and identified its strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, we investigated whether nonrepresentable criteria were associated with the utilized terminology systems. We analyzed ATLAS using 223 objective eligibility criteria from 30 randomly selected trials conducted in the last 10 years. In the next step, we selected appropriate ICD, OPS, LOINC, or ATC codes to feed the software. We classified each criterion and study based on its implementation capability in the software, ensuring a clear and logical progression of information. Based on our observations, 51% of the analyzed inclusion criteria were fully implemented in ATLAS. Within our selected example set, 10% of the studies were classified as fully portrayable, and 73% were portrayed to some extent. Additionally, we conducted an evaluation of the software regarding its technical limitations and interaction with medical classification systems. To improve and expand the scope of criteria within a cohort definition in a practical setting, it is recommended to work closely with personnel involved in the study to define the criteria precisely and to carefully select terminology systems. The chosen criteria should be combined according to the specific setting.

We classified patients with PUD who underwent rapid urease tests or Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) serology into three groups: H. pylori-related, drug [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin]-related, and idiopathic (H. pylori/NSAID/aspirin-negative) PUD and compared the yearly trends and characteristics among the three groups. RESULTS: We included 26785 patients in 7 databases, and the proportion of old age (>/= 65 years) was 38.8%. The overall number of PUD exhibited no decrease, whereas PUD in old age revealed an increasing trend (P = 0.01 for trend). Of the 19601 patients, 41.8% had H. pylori-related, 36.1% had drug-related, and 22.1% had idiopathic PUD. H. pylori-related PUD exhibited a decreasing trend after 2014 (P = 0.01), drug-related PUD demonstrated an increasing trend (P = 0.04), and idiopathic PUD showed an increasing trend in the old-age group (P = 0.01) during 10 years. Patients with drug-related PUD had significantly more comorbidities and concomitant ulcerogenic drugs. The idiopathic PUD group had a significantly higher number of patients with chronic liver disease. CONCLUSION: With the aging population increase, the effects of concomitant ulcerogenic drugs and preventive strategies should be investigated in drug-induced PUD. Further studies are required to clarify the relationship between idiopathic PUD and chronic liver disease.",Changing trends and characteristics of peptic ulcer disease: A multicenter study from 2010 to 2019 in Korea.,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Aspirin/pharmacology', '*Helicobacter Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/complications', '*Helicobacter pylori', '*Liver Diseases/complications', '*Peptic Ulcer/epidemiology/etiology', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology']",,

To achieve these goals, the Center Leon Berard (CLB) considers various data collection strategies, including electronic medical records (EMRs), clinical trial data, and research projects. Advanced data analysis techniques like natural language processing (NLP) can be used to extract and categorize information from these sources to provide a more complete description of patient data. Data sharing is also crucial for collaboration across comprehensive cancer centers, but it must be done securely and in compliance with regulations like GDPR. To ensure data is shared appropriately, CLB should develop clear data sharing policies and share data in a controlled, standardized format like OSIRIS RWD, OMOP and FHIR. The UNICANCER initiative has launched the CONSORE project to support the development of a structured and standardized repository of patient data to improve cancer research and patient outcomes. Real-world data (RWD) studies are vital in cancer research as they provide a comprehensive and accurate picture of patient outcomes and treatment patterns. By incorporating RWD into data collection, analysis, and sharing strategies, comprehensive cancer centers can take a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach to cancer research. In conclusion, comprehensive cancer centers must take an integrated approach to data collection, analysis, and sharing to enhance their understanding of cancer and improve patient outcomes. Leveraging advanced data analytics techniques and developing effective data sharing policies can help cancer centers effectively harness the power of data to drive progress in cancer research.",From data strategy to implementation to advance cancer research and cancer care: A French comprehensive cancer center experience.,,,

It enables large-scale observational research through standardizing the data into a common data model (CDM) (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership [OMOP] CDM) and requires a comprehensive, efficient, and reliable ontology system to support data harmonization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created the OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies-a common reference ontology mandatory to all data sites in the network. It comprises imported and de novo-generated ontologies containing concepts and relationships between them, and the praxis of converting the source data to the OMOP CDM based on these. It enables harmonization through assigned domains according to clinical categories, comprehensive coverage of entities within each domain, support for commonly used international coding schemes, and standardization of semantically equivalent concepts. RESULTS: The OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies comprise over 10 million concepts from 136 vocabularies. They are used by hundreds of groups and several large data networks. More than 8600 users have performed 50 000 downloads of the system. This open-source resource has proven to address an impediment of large-scale observational research-the dependence on the context of source data representation. With that, it has enabled efficient phenotyping, covariate construction, patient-level prediction, population-level estimation, and standard reporting. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: OHDSI has made available a comprehensive, open vocabulary system that is unmatched in its ability to support global observational research. We encourage researchers to exploit it and contribute their use cases to this dynamic resource.",OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies-a large-scale centralized reference ontology for international data harmonization.,"['Humans', '*Data Science', 'Vocabulary', '*Medical Informatics', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records']",,

Respiratory medicine,"BACKGROUND: Although vaccines have proved effective to prevent severe COVID-19, their effect on preventing long-term symptoms is not yet fully understood. We aimed to evaluate the overall effect of vaccination to prevent long COVID symptoms and assess comparative effectiveness of the most used vaccines (ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2). METHODS: We conducted a staggered cohort study using primary care records from the UK (Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] GOLD and AURUM), Catalonia, Spain (Information System for Research in Primary Care [SIDIAP]), and national health insurance claims from Estonia (CORIVA database). All adults who were registered for at least 180 days as of Jan 4, 2021 (the UK), Feb 20, 2021 (Spain), and Jan 28, 2021 (Estonia) comprised the source population. Vaccination status was used as a time-varying exposure, staggered by vaccine rollout period. Vaccinated people were further classified by vaccine brand according to their first dose received. The primary outcome definition of long COVID was defined as having at least one of 25 WHO-listed symptoms between 90 and 365 days after the date of a PCR-positive test or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, with no history of that symptom 180 days before SARS-Cov-2 infection. Propensity score overlap weighting was applied separately for each cohort to minimise confounding. Sub-distribution hazard ratios (sHRs) were calculated to estimate vaccine effectiveness against long COVID, and empirically calibrated using negative control outcomes. Random effects meta-analyses across staggered cohorts were conducted to pool overall effect estimates. FINDINGS: A total of 1 618 395 (CPRD GOLD), 5 729 800 (CPRD AURUM), 2 744 821 (SIDIAP), and 77 603 (CORIVA) vaccinated people and 1 640 371 (CPRD GOLD), 5 860 564 (CPRD AURUM), 2 588 518 (SIDIAP), and 302 267 (CORIVA) unvaccinated people were included. Compared with unvaccinated people, overall HRs for long COVID symptoms in people vaccinated with a first dose of any COVID-19 vaccine were 0.54 (95% CI 0.44-0.67) in CPRD GOLD, 0.48 (0.34-0.68) in CPRD AURUM, 0.71 (0.55-0.91) in SIDIAP, and 0.59 (0.40-0.87) in CORIVA. A slightly stronger preventative effect was seen for the first dose of BNT162b2 than for ChAdOx1 (sHR 0.85 [0.60-1.20] in CPRD GOLD and 0.84 [0.74-0.94] in CPRD AURUM). INTERPRETATION: Vaccination against COVID-19 consistently reduced the risk of long COVID symptoms, which highlights the importance of vaccination to prevent persistent COVID-19 symptoms, particularly in adults.

This study presents a framework that can allow institutions to map their notes to the LOINC document ontology using a Bag of Words approach. After preliminary manual value- set mapping, an automated pipeline that leverages key dimensions of metadata from structured EHR fields aligns the notes with the dimensions of the document ontology.

Despite the efforts of promoting and improving this ontology, how to efficiently deploy it in real-world clinical settings has yet to be explored. In this study we evaluated the utility of LOINC DO by mapping clinical note titles collected from five institutions to the LOINC DO and classifying the mapping into three classes based on semantic similarity between note titles and LOINC DO codes. Additionally, we developed a standardization pipeline that automatically maps clinical note titles from multiple sites to suitable LOINC DO codes, without accessing the content of clinical notes. The pipeline can be initialized with different large language models, and we compared the performances between them. The results showed that our automated pipeline achieved an accuracy of 0.90.

Patients were excluded if they had evidence of previous knee arthroplasty, knee fracture, knee surgery (except diagnostic), rheumatoid arthritis, infammatory arthropathies, or septic arthritis. Opioid use from 91-365 days after surgery, as a proxy for persistent pain, was assessed for all participants in all databases. Postoperative complications (ie, venous thromboembolism, infection, readmission, and mortality) were assessed over the 60 days after surgery and implant survival (as measured by revision procedures) was assessed over the 5 years after surgery. Outcomes were assessed in all databases, except for readmission, which was assessed in three of the databases, and mortality, which was assessed in two of the databases. Propensity score matched Cox proportional hazards models were fitted for each outcome. Calibrated hazard ratios (cHRs) were generated for each database to account for observed differences in control outcomes, and cHRs were then combined using meta-analysis. FINDINGS: 33 867 individuals who received UKR and 557 831 individuals who received TKR between Jan 1, 2005, and April 30, 2018, were eligible for matching. 32 379 with UKR and 250 377 with TKR were propensity score matched and informed the analyses. UKR was associated with a reduced risk of postoperative opioid use (cHR from meta-analysis 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.90) and a reduced risk of venous thromboembolism (0.62, 0.36-0.95), whereas no difference was seen for infection (0.85, 0.51-1.37) and readmission (0.79, 0.47-1.25). Evidence was insufficient to conclude whether there was a reduction in risk of mortality. UKR was also associated with an increased risk of revision (1.64, 1.40-1.94). INTERPRETATION: UKR was associated with a reduced risk of postoperative opioid use compared with TKR, which might indicate a reduced risk of persistent pain after surgery. UKR was associated with a lower risk of venous thromboembolism but an increased risk of revision compared with TKR. These findings can help to inform shared decision making for individuals eligible for knee replacement surgery.

The objective of this study was to estimate the performance characteristics of phenotype algorithms designed for increasing specificity and to estimate the immortal time associated with each algorithm. Materials and methods: We examined algorithms for 11 chronic health conditions. The analyses were from data from five databases. For each health condition, we created five algorithms to examine performance (sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV)) differences: one broad algorithm using a single code for the health condition and four narrow algorithms where a second diagnosis code was required 1-30 days, 1-90 days, 1-365 days, or 1- all days in a subject's continuous observation period after the first code. We also examined the proportion of immortal time relative to time-at-risk (TAR) for four outcomes. The TAR's were: 0-30 days after the first condition occurrence (the index date), 0-90 days post-index, 0-365 days post-index, and 0-1,095 days post-index. Performance of algorithms for chronic health conditions was estimated using PheValuator (V2.1.4) from the OHDSI toolstack. Immortal time was calculated as the time from the index date until the first of the following: 1) the outcome; 2) the end of the outcome TAR; 3) the occurrence of the second code for the chronic health condition. Results: In the first analysis, the narrow phenotype algorithms, i.e., those requiring a second condition code, produced higher estimates for PPV and lower estimates for sensitivity compared to the single code algorithm. In all conditions, increasing the time to the required second code increased the sensitivity of the algorithm. In the second analysis, the amount of immortal time increased as the window used to identify the second diagnosis code increased. The proportion of TAR that was immortal was highest in the 30 days TAR analyses compared to the 1,095 days TAR analyses. Conclusion: Attempting to increase the specificity of a health condition algorithm by adding a second code is a potentially valid approach to increase specificity, albeit at the cost of incurring immortal time.",Comparing broad and narrow phenotype algorithms: differences in performance characteristics and immortal time incurred.,"['Humans', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Algorithms', 'Phenotype', 'Databases, Factual', '*Upper Extremity Deformities, Congenital']",,

With the aid of such large data pools, researchers are able to develop clinical prediction models for improved disease classification, risk assessment, and beyond. To fully utilize this potential, Machine Learning (ML) methods are commonly required to process these large amounts of data on disease-specific patient cohorts. As a consequence, the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) collaborative develops a framework to facilitate the application of ML models for these standardized patient datasets by using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). In this study, we compare the feasibility of current web-based OHDSI approaches, namely ATLAS and ""Patient-level Prediction"" (PLP), against a native solution (R based) to conduct such ML-based patient-level prediction analyses in OMOP. This will enable potential users to select the most suitable approach for their investigation. Each of the applied ML solutions was individually utilized to solve the same patient-level prediction task. Both approaches went through an exemplary benchmarking analysis to assess the weaknesses and strengths of the PLP R-Package. In this work, the performance of this package was subsequently compared versus the commonly used native R-package called Machine Learning in R 3 (mlr3), and its sub-packages. The approaches were evaluated on performance, execution time, and ease of model implementation. The results show that the PLP package has shorter execution times, which indicates great scalability, as well as intuitive code implementation, and numerous possibilities for visualization. However, limitations in comparison to native packages were depicted in the implementation of specific ML classifiers (e.g., Lasso), which may result in a decreased performance for real-world prediction problems.

METHODS: The study participants were patients with COVID-19 (n=5,006) and those without COVID-19 (n=367,162) registered in the database of Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital and standardized with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Data on major mental disorders that developed in both groups over the 5-year follow-up period were extracted using the FeederNet computer program. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the incidence of major mental disorders. RESULTS: The incidences of dementia and sleep, anxiety, and depressive disorders were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than in the control group. The incidence rates per 1,000 patient-years in the COVID-19 group vs. the control group were 12.71 vs. 3.76 for dementia, 17.42 vs. 7.91 for sleep disorders, 6.15 vs. 3.41 for anxiety disorders, and 8.30 vs. 5.78 for depressive disorders. There was no significant difference in the incidence of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder between the two groups.

Thus, terminology mapping is a necessary step to harmonize heterogeneous data. Take the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for example, the mapping between them is essential for drug safety and pharmacovigilance research. Our main objective is to provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the mapping status between MedDRA and ICD. We focus on evaluating the current mapping status between MedDRA and ICD through the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). We summarized the current mapping statistics and evaluated the quality of the current MedDRA-ICD mapping; for unmapped terms, we used our self-developed algorithm to rank the best possible mapping candidates for additional mapping coverage. RESULTS: The identified MedDRA-ICD mapped pairs cover 27.23% of the overall MedDRA preferred terms (PT). The systematic quality analysis demonstrated that, among the mapped pairs provided by UMLS, only 51.44% are considered an exact match. For the 2400 sampled unmapped terms, 56 of the 2400 MedDRA Preferred Terms (PT) could have exact match terms from ICD. CONCLUSION: Some of the mapped pairs between MedDRA and ICD are not exact matches due to differences in granularity and focus. For 72% of the unmapped PT terms, the identified exact match pairs illustrate the possibility of identifying additional mapped pairs. Referring to its own mapping standard, some of the unmapped terms should qualify for the expansion of MedDRA to ICD mapping in UMLS.",Evaluating MedDRA-to-ICD terminology mappings.,"['Humans', '*International Classification of Diseases', '*Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Algorithms']",,

This paper proposes a pan-African, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) research architecture and infrastructure named the INSPIRE datahub. This cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and on-premises setup aims to enhance the discovery, integration, and analysis of clinical, population-based surveys, and other health data sources. METHODS: The INSPIRE datahub, part of the Implementation Network for Sharing Population Information from Research Entities (INSPIRE), employs the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) open-source stack of tools and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to harmonise data from African longitudinal population studies. Operating on Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services cloud platforms, and on on-premises servers, the architecture offers adaptability and scalability for other cloud providers and technology infrastructure. The OHDSI-based tools enable a comprehensive suite of services for data pipeline development, profiling, mapping, extraction, transformation, loading, documentation, anonymization, and analysis. RESULTS: The INSPIRE datahub's ""On-ramp"" services facilitate the integration of data and metadata from diverse sources into the OMOP CDM. The datahub supports the implementation of OMOP CDM across data producers, harmonizing source data semantically with standard vocabularies and structurally conforming to OMOP table structures. Leveraging OHDSI tools, the datahub performs quality assessment and analysis of the transformed data. It ensures FAIR data by establishing metadata flows, capturing provenance throughout the ETL processes, and providing accessible metadata for potential users. The ETL provenance is documented in a machine- and human-readable Implementation Guide (IG), enhancing transparency and usability. CONCLUSION: The pan-African INSPIRE datahub presents a scalable and systematic solution for integrating health data in LMICs. By adhering to FAIR principles and leveraging established standards like OMOP CDM, this architecture addresses the current gap in generating evidence to support policy and decision-making for improving the well-being of LMIC populations. The federated research network provisions allow data producers to maintain control over their data, fostering collaboration while respecting data privacy and security concerns.

Previous methods focused on fixed-time risk prediction, however, time-to-event prediction is often more appropriate for clinical scenarios. Here, we present STRAFE, a generalizable survival analysis Transformer-based architecture for electronic health records. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The input for STRAFE is a sequence of visits with SNOMED-CT codes in OMOP-CDM format. A Transformer-based architecture was developed to calculate probabilities of the occurrence of the event in each of 48 months. Performance was evaluated using a real-world claims dataset of over 130 000 individuals with stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: STRAFE showed improved mean absolute error (MAE) compared to other time-to-event algorithms in predicting the time to deterioration to stage 5 CKD. Additionally, STRAFE showed an improved area under the receiver operating curve compared to binary outcome algorithms. We show that STRAFE predictions can improve the positive predictive value of high-risk patients by 3-fold. Finally, we suggest a novel visualization approach to predictions on a per-patient basis. DISCUSSION: Time-to-event predictions are the most appropriate approach for clinical predictions. Our deep-learning algorithm outperformed not only other time-to-event prediction algorithms but also fixed-time algorithms, possibly due to its ability to train on censored data. We demonstrated possible clinical usage by identifying the highest-risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to accurately identify patients at high risk and prioritize their needs can result in improved health outcomes, reduced costs, and more efficient use of resources.",Transformer-based time-to-event prediction for chronic kidney disease deterioration.,"['Humans', '*Renal Insufficiency, Chronic', 'Algorithms', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Probability', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine']",,

However, due to the heterogeneity of source data, it is difficult to analyze such data in a unified way across clinics. Therefore, the implementation of Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) or Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) processes for harmonizing local health data is necessary, in order to guarantee the data quality for research. However, the development of such processes is time-consuming and unsustainable. A promising way to ease this is the generalization of ETL/ELT processes. OBJECTIVE: In this work, we investigate existing possibilities for the development of generic ETL/ELT processes. Particularly, we focus on approaches with low development complexity by using descriptive metadata and structural metadata. METHODS: We conducted a literature review following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We used 4 publication databases (ie, PubMed, IEEE Explore, Web of Science, and Biomed Center) to search for relevant publications from 2012 to 2022. The PRISMA flow was then visualized using an R-based tool (Evidence Synthesis Hackathon). All relevant contents of the publications were extracted into a spreadsheet for further analysis and visualization. RESULTS: Regarding the PRISMA guidelines, we included 33 publications in this literature review. All included publications were categorized into 7 different focus groups (ie, medicine, data warehouse, big data, industry, geoinformatics, archaeology, and military). Based on the extracted data, ontology-based and rule-based approaches were the 2 most used approaches in different thematic categories. Different approaches and tools were chosen to achieve different purposes within the use cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our literature review shows that using metadata-driven (MDD) approaches to develop an ETL/ELT process can serve different purposes in different thematic categories. The results show that it is promising to implement an ETL/ELT process by applying MDD approach to automate the data transformation from Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources to Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. However, the determining of an appropriate MDD approach and tool to implement such an ETL/ELT process remains a challenge. This is due to the lack of comprehensive insight into the characterizations of the MDD approaches presented in this study. Therefore, our next step is to evaluate the MDD approaches presented in this study and to determine the most appropriate MDD approaches and the way to integrate them into the ETL/ELT process. This could verify the ability of using MDD approaches to generalize the ETL process for harmonizing medical data.",Use of Metadata-Driven Approaches for Data Harmonization in the Medical Domain: Scoping Review.,,,

The embedded MIRACUM Use Case ""Alerting in Care - IT Support for Patient Recruitment"", aims to support the recruitment into clinical trials by automatically querying the repositories for patients satisfying eligibility criteria and presenting them as screening candidates. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the developed recruitment tool has a positive effect on study recruitment within a multi-center environment by increasing the number of participants. Its secondary objective is the measurement of organizational burden and user satisfaction of the provided IT solution. METHODS: The study uses an Interrupted Time Series Design with a duration of 15 months. All trials start in the control phase of randomized length with regular recruitment and change to the intervention phase with additional IT support. The intervention consists of the application of a recruitment-support system which uses patient data collected in general care for screening according to specific criteria. The inclusion and exclusion criteria of all selected trials are translated into a machine-readable format using the OHDSI ATLAS tool. All patient data from the data integration centers is regularly checked against these criteria. The primary outcome is the number of participants recruited per trial and week standardized by the targeted number of participants per week and the expected recruitment duration of the specific trial. Secondary outcomes are usability, usefulness, and efficacy of the recruitment support. Sample size calculation based on simple parallel group assumption can demonstrate an effect size of d=0.57 on a significance level of 5% and a power of 80% with a total number of 100 trials (10 per site). Data describing the included trials and the recruitment process is collected at each site. The primary analysis will be conducted using linear mixed models with the actual recruitment number per week and trial standardized by the expected recruitment number per week and trial as the dependent variable.

This allows for the creation of shared end-to-end analysis packages without the need for direct data exchange, thereby enhancing data security and privacy. By securely sharing de-identified and aggregated data and conducting analyses across multiple OMOP-converted databases, patient-level data is securely firewalled within its respective local site.Results By simplifying data management processes and governance, and through the promotion of interoperability, the OMOP-CDM supports a wide range of clinical, epidemiological, and translational research projects, as well as health service operational reporting.Discussion Adoption of the OMOP-CDM internationally and locally enables conversion of vast amounts of complex, and heterogeneous EMR data into a standardised structured data model, simplifies governance processes, and facilitates rapid repeatable cross-institution analysis through shared end-to-end analysis packages, without the sharing of data.Conclusion The adoption of the OMOP-CDM has the potential to transform health data analytics by providing a common platform for analysing EMR data across diverse healthcare settings.","Seamless EMR data access: Integrated governance, digital health and the OMOP-CDM.","['Humans', '*Digital Health', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Databases, Factual', 'Data Management']",,

Consequently, linking clinical data with claims data is necessary. To ensure their syntactic and semantic interoperability, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community was chosen. However, there is no detailed guide that would allow researchers to follow a generic process for data harmonization, i.e. the transformation of local source data into the standardized OMOP CDM format. Thus, the aim of this paper is to conceptualize a generic data harmonization process for OMOP CDM. METHODS: For this purpose, we conducted a literature review focusing on publications that address the harmonization of clinical or claims data in OMOP CDM. Subsequently, the process steps used and their chronological order as well as applied OHDSI tools were extracted for each included publication. The results were then compared to derive a generic sequence of the process steps. RESULTS: From 23 publications included, a generic data harmonization process for OMOP CDM was conceptualized, consisting of nine process steps: dataset specification, data profiling, vocabulary identification, coverage analysis of vocabularies, semantic mapping, structural mapping, extract-transform-load-process, qualitative and quantitative data quality analysis. Furthermore, we identified seven OHDSI tools which supported five of the process steps.

The external validation included 31 932 (UK), 23 100 (US), 7295 (Korea), and 3934 (Finland) patients with POU of 44.2%, 22.0%, 15.8%, and 21.8%, respectively. The top-performing model, Lasso logistic regression, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.75 during local validation and 0.69 (SD = 0.02) (averaged) in external validation. Models trained with cross-site feature selection significantly outperformed those using only features from the development site through external validation (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Using EHRs across four countries mapped to the OMOP CDM, we developed generalizable predictive models for POU. Our approach demonstrates the significant impact of cross-site feature selection in improving model performance, underscoring the importance of incorporating diverse feature sets from various clinical settings to enhance the generalizability and utility of predictive healthcare models.",Towards global model generalizability: independent cross-site feature evaluation for patient-level risk prediction models using the OHDSI network.,"['Humans', '*Data Science', '*Medical Informatics', 'Logistic Models', 'United Kingdom', 'Finland']",,

METHODS: Data was harmonized from four Danish observational health databases into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. With a data-driven approach using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator logistic regression on preoperative data, we developed 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality prediction models. We assessed discriminative performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curve and calibration using calibration slope, intercept, and calibration-in-the-large. We additionally assessed model performance in subgroups of curative, palliative, elective, and emergency surgery. RESULTS: A total of 57,521 patients were included in the study population, 51.1% male and with a median age of 72 years. The model showed good discrimination with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88, 0.878, and 0.861 for 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality, respectively, and a calibration-in-the-large of 1.01, 0.99, and 0.99. The overall incidence of mortality were 4.48% for 30-day mortality, 6.64% for 90-day mortality, and 12.8% for 1-year mortality, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed no improvement of discrimination or calibration when separating the cohort into cohorts of elective surgery, emergency surgery, curative surgery, and palliative surgery. CONCLUSION: We were able to train prediction models for the risk of short-term mortality on a data set of four combined national health databases with good discrimination and calibration. We found that one cohort including all operated patients resulted in better performing models than cohorts based on several subgroups.","Prediction of 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year mortality after colorectal cancer surgery using a data-driven approach.","['Humans', 'Male', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Digestive System Surgical Procedures', 'Calibration', 'Databases, Factual', 'Elective Surgical Procedures', '*Colorectal Neoplasms/surgery']",,

The community has seen rapid growth in publications, citations, and the number of authors. Components of its successful uptake have been attributed to an open science and collaborative culture for research and development. Investigating the adoption of OHDSI as a field of study provides an opportunity to understand how communities embrace new ideas, onboard new members, and enhance their impact. OBJECTIVE: To track, study, and evaluate an open scientific community's growth and impact. METHOD: We present a modern architecture leveraging open application programming interfaces to capture publicly available data (PubMed, YouTube, and EHDEN) on open science activities (publication, teaching, and engagement). RESULTS: Three interactive dashboard were implemented for each publicly available artifact (PubMed, YouTube, and EHDEN). Each dashboard provides longitudinal summary analysis and has a searchable table, which differs in the available features related to each public artifact. CONCLUSION: We discuss the insights enabled by our approach to monitor the growth and impact of the OHDSI community by capturing artifacts of learning, teaching, and creation. We share the implications for different users based on their functional needs.

Epub 2024 Mar 1.,2024/03/03 19:18,Journal of biomedical informatics,"OBJECTIVE: Machine learning methods hold the promise of leveraging available data and generating higher-quality data while alleviating the data collection burden on healthcare professionals. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses data, collected globally for billing and epidemiological purposes, represents a valuable source of structured information. However, ICD coding is a challenging task. While numerous previous studies reported promising results in automatic ICD classification, they often describe input data specific model architectures, that are heterogeneously evaluated with different performance metrics and ICD code subsets. This study aims to explore the evaluation and construction of more effective Computer Assisted Coding (CAC) systems using generic approaches, focusing on the use of ICD hierarchy, medication data and a feed forward neural network architecture. METHODS: We conduct comprehensive experiments using the MIMIC-III clinical database, mapped to the OMOP data model. Our evaluations encompass various performance metrics, alongside investigations into multitask, hierarchical, and imbalanced learning for neural networks. RESULTS: We introduce a novel metric, , tailored to the ICD coding task, which offers interpretable insights for healthcare informatics practitioners, aiding them in assessing the quality of assisted coding systems. Our findings highlight that selectively cherry-picking ICD codes diminish retrieval performance without performance improvement over the selected subset. We show that optimizing for metrics such as NDCG and AUPRC outperforms traditional F1-based metrics in ranking performance. We observe that Neural Network training on different ICD levels simultaneously offers minor benefits for ranking and significant runtime gains. However, our models do not derive benefits from hierarchical or class imbalance correction techniques for ICD code retrieval. CONCLUSION: This study offers valuable insights for researchers and healthcare practitioners interested in developing and evaluating CAC systems. Using a straightforward sequential neural network model, we confirm that medical prescriptions are a rich data source for CAC systems, providing competitive retrieval capabilities for a fraction of the computational load compared to text-based models. Our study underscores the importance of metric selection and challenges existing practices related to ICD code sub-setting for model training and evaluation.",Creating a computer assisted ICD coding system: Performance metric choice and use of the ICD hierarchy.,"['Humans', '*International Classification of Diseases', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Neural Networks, Computer', 'Machine Learning', 'Computers', 'Clinical Coding/methods']",,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the software tools and demonstrated their utility by replicating a UK-based heart failure data analysis across 5 different international databases from Estonia, Spain, Serbia, and the United States. RESULTS: We examined treatment trajectories of 47 163 patients. The overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for telemonitoring relative to standard of care was 57 472 euro/QALY. Country-specific ICERs were 60 312 euro/QALY in Estonia, 58 096 euro/QALY in Spain, 40 372 euro/QALY in Serbia, and 90 893 euro/QALY in the US, which surpassed the established willingness-to-pay thresholds. DISCUSSION: Currently, the cost-effectiveness analysis lacks standard tools, is performed in ad-hoc manner, and relies heavily on published information that might not be specific for local circumstances. Published results often exhibit a narrow focus, central to a single site, and provide only partial decision criteria, limiting their generalizability and comprehensive utility. CONCLUSION: We created 2 R-packages to pioneer cost-effectiveness analysis in OMOP CDM data networks.

This study analyzed retrospective health claims data in Korea from 2012 to 2017 that were transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. The pooled proportion of constipation diagnoses was 30.5% in all patients with CKD and 15.9%, 16.5%, 17.4%, 29.9%, and 43.3% in patients with CKD stages 1-5, respectively, suggesting a higher prevalence in advanced CKD. Patients receiving peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis had the highest prevalence of constipation, while transplant recipients showed a prevalence comparable to that of patients with early CKD. Patients with CKD had a significantly higher risk of constipation than age- and sex-matched non-CKD individuals (range of odds ratio [OR]:1.66-1.90). Laxative prescribing patterns differed by CKD severity. Osmotic agents were prescribed in more than half of patients with advanced CKD, while magnesium salts and bulking agents were prescribed less frequently. The CKD patients with constipation were more likely to be prescribed constipation-inducing medications, including antipsychotic and neurological medications.

Emergency departments (EDs) are crucial healthcare settings in managing self-harm, but clinician uncertainty in risk assessment may contribute to ineffective care. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) show promise in enhancing care processes, but their effective implementation in self-harm management remains unexplored. METHODS: PERMANENS comprises a combination of methodologies and study designs aimed at developing a CDSS prototype that assists clinicians in the personalized assessment and management of ED patients presenting with self-harm. Ensemble prediction models will be constructed by applying machine learning techniques on electronic registry data from four sites, i.e., Catalonia (Spain), Ireland, Norway, and Sweden. These models will predict key adverse outcomes including self-harm repetition, suicide, premature death, and lack of post-discharge care. Available registry data include routinely collected electronic health record data, mortality data, and administrative data, and will be harmonized using the OMOP Common Data Model, ensuring consistency in terminologies, vocabularies and coding schemes. A clinical knowledge base of effective suicide prevention interventions will be developed rooted in a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines, including quality assessment of guidelines using the AGREE II tool. The CDSS software prototype will include a backend that integrates the prediction models and the clinical knowledge base to enable accurate patient risk stratification and subsequent intervention allocation. The CDSS frontend will enable personalized risk assessment and will provide tailored treatment plans, following a tiered evidence-based approach. Implementation research will ensure the CDSS' practical functionality and feasibility, and will include periodic meetings with user-advisory groups, mixed-methods research to identify currently unmet needs in self-harm risk assessment, and small-scale usability testing of the CDSS prototype software. DISCUSSION: Through the development of the proposed CDSS software prototype, PERMANENS aims to standardize care, enhance clinician confidence, improve patient satisfaction, and increase treatment compliance. The routine integration of CDSS for self-harm risk assessment within healthcare systems holds significant potential in effectively reducing suicide mortality rates by facilitating personalized and timely delivery of effective interventions on a large scale for individuals at risk of suicide.",Developing a clinical decision support system software prototype that assists in the management of patients with self-harm in the emergency department: protocol of the PERMANENS project.,"['Humans', '*Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Aftercare', 'Patient Discharge', 'Software', '*Self-Injurious Behavior/diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Systematic Reviews as Topic']",,

Retina,"PURPOSE: To characterize the incidence of kidney failure associated with intravitreal anti-VEGF exposure; and compare the risk of kidney failure in patients treated with ranibizumab, aflibercept, or bevacizumab. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study across 12 databases in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network. SUBJECTS: Subjects aged >/= 18 years with >/= 3 monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF medications for a blinding disease (diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, exudative age-related macular degeneration, or retinal vein occlusion). METHODS: The standardized incidence proportions and rates of kidney failure while on treatment with anti-VEGF were calculated. For each comparison (e.g., aflibercept versus ranibizumab), patients from each group were matched 1:1 using propensity scores. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of kidney failure while on treatment. A random effects meta-analysis was performed to combine each database's hazard ratio (HR) estimate into a single network-wide estimate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of kidney failure while on anti-VEGF treatment, and time from cohort entry to kidney failure. RESULTS: Of the 6.1 million patients with blinding diseases, 37 189 who received ranibizumab, 39 447 aflibercept, and 163 611 bevacizumab were included; the total treatment exposure time was 161 724 person-years. The average standardized incidence proportion of kidney failure was 678 per 100 000 persons (range, 0-2389), and incidence rate 742 per 100 000 person-years (range, 0-2661). The meta-analysis HR of kidney failure comparing aflibercept with ranibizumab was 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-1.47; P = 0.45), ranibizumab with bevacizumab 0.95 (95% CI, 0.68-1.32; P = 0.62), and aflibercept with bevacizumab 0.95 (95% CI, 0.65-1.39; P = 0.60). CONCLUSIONS: There was no substantially different relative risk of kidney failure between those who received ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept. Practicing ophthalmologists and nephrologists should be aware of the risk of kidney failure among patients receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF medications and that there is little empirical evidence to preferentially choose among the specific intravitreal anti-VEGF agents.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are analgesics commonly used for musculoskeletal pain; however, NSAIDs can increase the risk of certain adverse events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, edema, heart failure, and hypertension. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize existing comorbidities among patients with OA. For patients with OA with and without a coexisting medical condition of interest (CMCOI), we estimated the prevalence of prescribing and dispensing NSAIDs pre-OA and post-OA diagnosis. METHODS: Data from three large administrative claims databases were used to construct an OA retrospective cohort. Databases leveraged were IBM MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Database (MDCR), IBM MarketScan Commercial Database (CCAE), and Optum's de-identified Clinformatics((R)) Data Mart Database (Optum CDM). The OA study population was defined to be those patients who had an OA diagnosis from an inpatient or outpatient visit with at least 365 days of prior observation time in the database during January 2000 through May 2021. Asthma, cardiovascular disorders, renal impairment, and gastrointestinal bleeding risks were the CMCOI of interest. Patients with OA were then classified as having or not having evidence of a CMCOI. For both groups, NSAID dispensing patterns pre-OA and post-OA diagnosis were identified. Descriptive analysis was performed within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics framework. RESULTS: In each database, the proportion of the OA population with at least one CMCOI was nearly 50% or more (48.0% CCAE; 74.4% MDCR; 68.6% Optum CDM). Cardiovascular disease was the most commonly observed CMCOI in each database, and in two databases, nearly one in four patients with OA had two or more CMCOI (23.2% MDCR; 22.6% Optum CDM). Among the OA population with CMCOI, NSAID utilization post-OA diagnosis ranged from 33.0 to 46.2%. Following diagnosis of OA, an increase in the prescribing and dispensing of NSAIDs was observed in all databases, regardless of patient CMCOI presence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides real-world evidence of the pattern of prescribing and dispensing of NSAIDs among patients with OA with and without CMCOI, which indicates that at least half of patients with OA in the USA have a coexisting condition. These conditions may increase the risk of side effects commonly associated with NSAIDs. Yet, at least 32% of these patients were prescribed and dispensed NSAIDs. These data support the importance of shared decision making between healthcare professionals and patients when considering NSAIDs for the treatment of OA in patients with NSAID-relevant coexisting medical conditions.",Patterns of Comorbidities and Prescribing and Dispensing of Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Among Patients with Osteoarthritis in the USA: Real-World Study.,"['Humans', 'Aged', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Medicare', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects', '*Osteoarthritis/complications/drug therapy/epidemiology', '*Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/chemically induced/drug therapy']",,

This includes an increase in the incidence of CD in countries and geographic regions where CD was not previously prevalent. In response to the increasing incidence, the pediatric care landscape is facing growing challenges. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken to comprehensively delineate the incidence rates of CD in pediatric populations across different countries and to explore potential influencing factors. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of PubMed and Embase (via Ovid) for studies from January 1, 1970, to December 31, 2019. In addition, a manual search was performed in relevant and previously published reviews. The results were evaluated quantitatively. For this purpose, random effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were performed to investigate the overall incidence rate and possible factors influencing the incidence. RESULTS: A qualitative synthesis of 74 studies was performed, with 72 studies included in the meta-analyses and 52 in the meta-regressions. The results of our meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity between the individual studies, which cannot be explained by a sample effect alone. Our findings showed geographical differences in incidence rates, which increased with increasing distance from the equator, although no global temporal trend was apparent. The meta-regression analysis also identified geographic location, UV index, and Human Development Index as significant moderators associated with CD incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pediatric CD incidence has increased in many countries since 1970 but varies widely with geographic location, which may pose challenges to the respective health care systems. We identified geographic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors that contribute to the observed heterogeneity in incidence rates. These results can serve as a basis for future research. To this end, implementations of internationally standardized and interoperable registries combined with the dissemination of health data through federated networks based on a common data model, such as the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership, would be beneficial. This would deepen the understanding of CD and promote evidence-based approaches to preventive and interventional strategies as well as inform public health policies aimed at addressing the increasing burden of CD in children and adolescents.

A federated data network (FDN) approach brings together multiple data sources harmonized for collaboration to increase the power of observational research. In this paper, we review how to increase reproducibility and transparency of RWE studies in rare diseases through disease-specific FDNs. METHOD: To be successful, a multiple stakeholder scientific FDN collaboration requires a strong governance model in place. In such a model, each database owner remains in full control regarding the use of and access to patient-level data and is responsible for data privacy, ethical, and legal compliance. Provided that all this is well documented and good database descriptions are in place, such a governance model results in increased transparency, while reproducibility is achieved through data curation and harmonization, and distributed analytical methods. RESULTS: Leveraging the OHDSI community set of methods and tools, two rare disease-specific FDNs are discussed in more detail. For multiple myeloma, HONEUR-the Haematology Outcomes Network in Europe-has built a strong community among the data partners dedicated to scientific exchange and research.

Reporting from specialized centers suggests long delays to referral and underuse of surgery; however, longitudinal data are limited to characterize neurodiagnostic evaluation among patients with DRE in more diverse US settings and populations. OBJECTIVE: To examine the rate and factors associated with neurodiagnostic studies and comprehensive evaluation among patients with DRE within 3 US cohorts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model including US multistate Medicaid data, commercial claims data, and Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) electronic health record data. Patients meeting a validated computable phenotype algorithm for DRE between January 1, 2015, and April 1, 2020, were included. No eligible participants were excluded. EXPOSURE: Demographic and clinical variables were queried. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The proportion of patients receiving a composite proxy for comprehensive neurodiagnostic evaluation, including (1) magnetic resonance or other advanced brain imaging, (2) video electroencephalography, and (3) neuropsychological evaluation within 2 years of meeting the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 33 542 patients with DRE were included in the Medicaid cohort, 22 496 in the commercial insurance cohort, and 2741 in the CUMC database. A total of 31 516 patients (53.6%) were women. The proportion of patients meeting the comprehensive evaluation main outcome in the Medicaid cohort was 4.5% (n = 1520); in the commercial insurance cohort, 8.0% (n = 1796); and in the CUMC cohort, 14.3% (n = 393). Video electroencephalography (24.9% Medicaid, 28.4% commercial, 63.2% CUMC) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (35.6% Medicaid, 43.4% commercial, 52.6% CUMC) were performed more regularly than neuropsychological evaluation (13.0% Medicaid, 16.6% commercial, 19.2% CUMC) or advanced imaging (3.2% Medicaid, 5.4% commercial, 13.1% CUMC). Factors independently associated with greater odds of evaluation across all 3 data sets included the number of inpatient and outpatient nonemergency epilepsy visits and focal rather than generalized epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest there is a gap in the use of diagnostic studies to evaluate patients with DRE. Care setting, insurance type, frequency of nonemergency visits, and epilepsy type are all associated with evaluation.

However, these therapies come with their fair share of toxicities and side effects. The goal of this observational study is to report drug-related adverse events (AEs), which are correlated with systemic combination therapies for mHSPC. Determining the optimal treatment option requires large cohorts to estimate the tolerability and AEs of these combination therapies in ""real-life"" patients with mHSPC, as provided in this study. We use a network of databases that includes population-based registries, electronic health records, and insurance claims, containing the overall target population and subgroups of patients defined by unique certain characteristics, demographics, and comorbidities, to compute the incidence of common AEs associated with systemic therapies in the setting of mHSPC. These data sources are standardised using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. We perform the descriptive statistics as well as calculate the AE incidence rate separately for each treatment group, stratified by age groups and index year. The time until the first event is estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method within each age group. In the case of episodic events, the anticipated mean cumulative counts of events are calculated. Our study will allow clinicians to tailor optimal therapies for mHSPC patients, and they will serve as a basis for comparative method studies.",Research Protocol for an Observational Health Data Analysis on the Adverse Events of Systemic Treatment in Patients with Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: Big Data Analytics Using the PIONEER Platform.,,,

Despite this, the optimal therapy for patients with mPCa has not been determined. This systematic review identifies available predictive models that assess mPCa patients' response to treatment. METHODS: We critically reviewed MEDLINE and CENTRAL in December 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Only quantitative studies in English were included with no time restrictions. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the PROBAST tool. Data were extracted following the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews criteria. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: The search identified 616 citations, of which 15 studies were included in our review. Nine of the included studies were validated internally or externally. Only one study had a low risk of bias and a low risk concerning applicability. Many studies failed to detail model performance adequately, resulting in a high risk of bias. Where reported, the models indicated good or excellent performance. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Most of the identified predictive models require additional evaluation and validation in properly designed studies before these can be implemented in clinical practice to assist with treatment decision-making for men with mPCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this review, we evaluate studies that predict which treatments will work best for which metastatic prostate cancer patients.

Yet, poor recruitment remains the most frequent reason for premature discontinuation or costly extension of clinical trials. METHODS: We designed and implemented a novel, open-source software system to support the recruitment process in clinical trials by generating automatic recruitment recommendations. The development is guided by modern, cloud-native design principles and based on Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) as an interoperability standard with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) being used as a source of patient data. We evaluated the usability using the system usability scale (SUS) after deploying the application for use by study personnel. RESULTS: The implementation is based on the OMOP CDM as a repository of patient data that is continuously queried for possible trial candidates based on given clinical trial eligibility criteria. A web-based screening list can be used to display the candidates and email notifications about possible new trial participants can be sent automatically. All interactions between services use HL7 FHIR as the communication standard. The system can be installed using standard container technology and supports more sophisticated deployments on Kubernetes clusters. End-users (n = 19) rated the system with a SUS score of 79.9/100. CONCLUSION: We contribute a novel, open-source implementation to support the patient recruitment process in clinical trials that can be deployed using state-of-the art technologies.

This secondary data, as found in electronic medical records (EMRs), can be optimised through conversion into a uniform data structure to enable analysis alongside other comparable health metric datasets. This can be achieved with the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM), which employs a standardised vocabulary to facilitate systematic analysis across various observational databases. The concept behind the OMOP-CDM is the conversion of data into a common format through the harmonisation of terminologies, vocabularies, and coding schemes within a unique repository. The OMOP model enhances research capacity through the development of shared analytic and prediction techniques; pharmacovigilance for the active surveillance of drug safety; and 'validation' analyses across multiple institutions across Australia, the United States, Europe, and the Asia Pacific. In this research, we aim to investigate the use of the open-source OMOP-CDM in the PATRON primary care data repository. METHODS: We used standard structured query language (SQL) to construct, extract, transform, and load scripts to convert the data to the OMOP-CDM. The process of mapping distinct free-text terms extracted from various EMRs presented a substantial challenge, as many terms could not be automatically matched to standard vocabularies through direct text comparison. This resulted in a number of terms that required manual assignment. To address this issue, we implemented a strategy where our clinical mappers were instructed to focus only on terms that appeared with sufficient frequency. We established a specific threshold value for each domain, ensuring that more than 95% of all records were linked to an approved vocabulary like SNOMED once appropriate mapping was completed. To assess the data quality of the resultant OMOP dataset we utilised the OHDSI Data Quality Dashboard (DQD) to evaluate the plausibility, conformity, and comprehensiveness of the data in the PATRON repository according to the Kahn framework. RESULTS: Across three primary care EMR systems we converted data on 2.03 million active patients to version 5.4 of the OMOP common data model. The DQD assessment involved a total of 3,570 individual evaluations. Each evaluation compared the outcome against a predefined threshold. A 'FAIL' occurred when the percentage of non-compliant rows exceeded the specified threshold value. In this assessment of the primary care OMOP database described here, we achieved an overall pass rate of 97%. CONCLUSION: The OMOP CDM's widespread international use, support, and training provides a well-established pathway for data standardisation in collaborative research. Its compatibility allows the sharing of analysis packages across local and international research groups, which facilitates rapid and reproducible data comparisons. A suite of open-source tools, including the OHDSI Data Quality Dashboard (Version 1.4.1), supports the model. Its simplicity and standards-based approach facilitates adoption and integration into existing data processes.",The OMOP common data model in Australian primary care data: Building a quality research ready harmonised dataset.,"['Humans', 'Australia', '*Biomedical Research', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Europe', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Primary Health Care']",,

Health data is largely kept in isolated data silos and key infrastructure to aggregate these silos into standardized bodies of knowledge is underdeveloped. We describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a federated infrastructure to facilitate versatile secondary use of health data based on Health Data Space nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our proposed nodes are self-contained units that digest data through an extract-transform-load framework that pseudonymizes and links data with privacy-preserving record linkage and harmonizes into a common data model (OMOP CDM). To support collaborative analyses a multi-level feature store is also implemented. A feasibility experiment was conducted to test the infrastructures potential for machine learning operations and deployment of other apps (e.g., visualization). Nodes can be operated in a network at different levels of sharing according to the level of trust within the network. RESULTS: In a proof-of-concept study, a privacy-preserving registry for heart failure patients has been implemented as a real-world showcase for Health Data Space nodes at the highest trust level, linking multiple data sources including (a) electronical medical records from hospitals, (b) patient data from a telemonitoring system, and (c) data from Austria's national register of deaths. The registry is deployed at the tirol kliniken, a hospital carrier in the Austrian state of Tyrol, and currently includes 5,004 patients, with over 2.9 million measurements, over 574,000 observations, more than 63,000 clinical free text notes, and in total over 5.2 million data points. Data curation and harmonization processes are executed semi-automatically at each individual node according to data sharing policies to ensure data sovereignty, scalability, and privacy. As a feasibility test, a natural language processing model for classification of clinical notes was deployed and tested. DISCUSSION: The presented Health Data Space node infrastructure has proven to be practicable in a real-world implementation in a live and productive registry for heart failure. The present work was inspired by the European Health Data Space initiative and its spirit to interconnect health data silos for versatile secondary use of health data.",Health data space nodes for privacy-preserving linkage of medical data to support collaborative secondary analyses.,,,

Many areas of health inequity are well known, but there remain important unexplored areas, and for many populations in the USA, accessing data to visualize and monitor health equity is difficult. METHODS: We describe the development and evaluation of an open-source, R-Shiny application, the ""Health Equity Explorer (H2E),"" designed to enable users to explore health equity data in a way that can be easily shared within and across common data models (CDMs). RESULTS: We have developed a novel, scalable informatics tool to explore a wide variety of drivers of health, including patient-reported Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), using data in an OMOP CDM research data repository in a way that can be easily shared. We describe our development process, data schema, potential use cases, and pilot data for 705,686 people who attended our health system at least once since 2016. For this group, 996,382 unique observations for questions related to food and housing security were available for 324,630 patients (at least one answer for all 46% of patients) with 65,152 (20.1% of patients with at least one visit and answer) reporting food or housing insecurity at least once. CONCLUSIONS: H2E can be used to support dynamic and interactive explorations that include rich social and environmental data. The tool can support multiple CDMs and has the potential to support distributed health equity research and intervention on a national scale.",The Health Equity Explorer: An open-source resource for distributed health equity visualization and research across common data models.,,,

Our objectives were to evaluate the burden of HIV and major depressive disorder (MDD) in underrepresented groups and the frequency of the HIV/MDD comorbidity. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis combining collected survey and electronic health record (EHR) data. We ascertained HIV and MDD cases using Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership codes. We used multivariable logistic regression to obtain the odds ratio of HIV in AoU participants and MDD in AoU participants with HIV. RESULTS: The latest AoU data release includes 412 211 participants: 254 700 have at least one medical condition concept in their EHR, of whom 5193 (1.3%) had HIV, and 2238 (43%) of those with HIV had a diagnosis of MDD. Black AoU participants had approximately 4.58 times the odds of having an HIV diagnosis compared with the combined odds of all other racial groups. AoU participants with HIV were more likely to have MDD (p = 0.001) than were participants without HIV. CONCLUSION: Among AoU participants, Black individuals have a disproportionately high burden of HIV, pointing to underlying factors such as social determinants of health, limited access to healthcare or prevention resources, and potential systemic biases that contribute to these differences. In addition, HIV is a risk factor for mental health issues like MDD. Further data collection from people with HIV will elucidate contributing factors and the need for interventions.",The prevalence of major depressive disorder in people with HIV: Results from the All of Us Research Program.,,,

METHODS: TMUCRD was developed by integrating EHRs from three affiliated hospitals, including Taipei Medical University Hospital, Wan-Fang Hospital and Shuang-Ho Hospital. The data cover over 15 years and include diverse patient care information. The database was converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) for standardisation. RESULTS: TMUCRD comprises 89 tables (eg, 29 tables for each hospital and 2 linked tables), including demographics, diagnoses, medications, procedures and measurements, among others. It encompasses data from more than 4.15 million patients with various medical records, spanning from the year 2004 to 2021. The dataset offers insights into disease prevalence, medication usage, laboratory tests and patient characteristics. DISCUSSION: TMUCRD stands out due to its unique advantages, including diverse data types, comprehensive patient information, linked mortality and cancer registry data, regular updates and a swift application process. Its compatibility with the OMOP CDM enhances its usability and interoperability. CONCLUSION: TMUCRD serves as a valuable resource for researchers and scholars interested in leveraging RWD for clinical research.

Through automation, healthcare processes can be optimized, and clinical decisions can be supported. For any reuse of data, the quality, validity, and trustworthiness of data are essential, and it is the only way to guarantee that data can be reused sensibly. Specific requirements for the description and coding of reusable data are defined in the FAIR guiding principles for data stewardship. Various national research associations and infrastructure projects in the German healthcare sector have already clearly positioned themselves on the FAIR principles: both the infrastructures of the Medical Informatics Initiative and the University Medicine Network operate explicitly on the basis of the FAIR principles, as do the National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data and the German Center for Diabetes Research.To ensure that a resource complies with the FAIR principles, the degree of FAIRness should first be determined (so-called FAIR assessment), followed by the prioritization for improvement steps (so-called FAIRification). Since 2016, a set of tools and guidelines have been developed for both steps, based on the different, domain-specific interpretations of the FAIR principles.Neighboring European countries have also invested in the development of a national framework for semantic interoperability in the context of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. Concepts for comprehensive data enrichment were developed to simplify data analysis, for example, in the European Health Data Space or via the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The OMOP DRUG_STRENGTH reference table contains information on the strength or concentration of drugs, whereas the OMOP DRUG_EXPOSURE table contains information on patients' drug prescriptions or dispensations/claims. Based on DRUG_EXPOSURE data from the primary care databases Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (United Kingdom) and Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI, The Netherlands) and healthcare claims from PharMetrics(R) Plus for Academics (USA), we developed four formulas to calculate daily dose given different DRUG_STRENGTH reference table information. We tested the dose formulas by comparing the calculated median daily dose to the World Health Organization (WHO) Defined Daily Dose (DDD) for six different ingredients in those three databases and additional four international databases representing a variety of healthcare settings: MAITT (Estonia, healthcare claims and discharge summaries), IQVIA Disease Analyzer Germany (outpatient data), IQVIA Longitudinal Patient Database Belgium (outpatient data), and IMASIS Parc Salut (Spain, hospital data). Finally, in each database, we assessed the proportion of drug records for which daily dose calculations were possible using the suggested formulas. RESULTS: Applying the dose formulas, we obtained median daily doses that generally matched the WHO DDD definitions.

Phenopackets is an expert knowledge-driven schema designed to facilitate the storage and exchange of multimodal patient data, and support downstream analysis. The first goal of this paper is to explore model alignment by characterizing the common data models using a newly developed data transformation process and evaluation method. Second, using OMOP normalized clinical data, we evaluate the mapping of real-world patient data to Phenopackets. We evaluate the suitability of Phenopackets as a patient data representation for real-world clinical cases. METHODS: We identified mappings between OMOP and Phenopackets and applied them to a real patient dataset to assess the transformation's success. We analyzed gaps between the models and identified key considerations for transforming data between them. Further, to improve ambiguous alignment, we incorporated Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic type-based filtering to direct individual concepts to their most appropriate domain and conducted a domain-expert evaluation of the mapping's clinical utility. RESULTS: The OMOP to Phenopacket transformation pipeline was executed for 1,000 Alzheimer's disease patients and successfully mapped all required entities. However, due to missing values in OMOP for required Phenopacket attributes, 10.2 % of records were lost. The use of UMLS-semantic type filtering for ambiguous alignment of individual concepts resulted in 96 % agreement with clinical thinking, increased from 68 % when mapping exclusively by domain correspondence. CONCLUSION: This study presents a pipeline to transform data from OMOP to Phenopackets. We identified considerations for the transformation to ensure data quality, handling restrictions for successful Phenopacket validation and discrepant data formats. We identified unmappable Phenopacket attributes that focus on specialty use cases, such as genomics or oncology, which OMOP does not currently support. We introduce UMLS semantic type filtering to resolve ambiguous alignment to Phenopacket entities to be most appropriate for real-world interpretation. We provide a systematic approach to align OMOP and Phenopackets schemas. Our work facilitates future use of Phenopackets in clinical applications by addressing key barriers to interoperability when deriving a Phenopacket from real-world patient data.",Converting OMOP CDM to phenopackets: A model alignment and patient data representation evaluation.,"['Humans', '*Unified Medical Language System', 'Semantics', 'Electronic Health Records', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'Translational Research, Biomedical', 'Medical Informatics/methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Alzheimer Disease']",,

This study aimed to characterize the clinical presentation of post-acute symptoms and conditions in the Korean pediatric and adult populations. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed using a national, population-based database, which was encoded using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). We compared individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 to those diagnosed with influenza, focusing on the risk of developing prespecified symptoms and conditions commonly associated with the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Results: Propensity score matching yielded 1,656 adult and 343 pediatric SARS-CoV-2 and influenza pairs. Ninety days after diagnosis, no symptoms were found to have elevated risk in either adults or children when compared with influenza controls. Conversely, at 1 day after diagnosis, adults with SARS-CoV-2 exhibited a significantly higher risk of developing abnormal liver function tests, cardiorespiratory symptoms, constipation, cough, thrombophlebitis/thromboembolism, and pneumonia. In contrast, children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 did not show an increased risk for any symptoms during either acute or post-acute phases. Conclusions: In the acute phase after infection, SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an elevated risk of certain symptoms in adults. The risk of developing post-acute COVID-19 sequelae is not significantly different from that of having postviral symptoms in children in both the acute and post-acute phases, and in adults in the post-acute phase. These observations warrant further validation through studies, including the severity of initial illness, vaccination status, and variant types.",Symptoms and Conditions in Children and Adults up to 90 Days after SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Retrospective Observational Study Utilizing the Common Data Model.,,,

However, such collaborations are hampered by heterogeneous data representations across cohorts and legal constraints to data sharing. The first arises from a lack of consensus in standards of data collection and representation across cohort studies and is usually tackled by applying data harmonization processes. The second is increasingly important due to raised awareness for privacy protection and stricter regulations, such as the GDPR. Federated learning has emerged as a privacy-preserving alternative to transferring data between institutions through analyzing data in a decentralized manner. METHODS: In this study, we set up a federated learning infrastructure for a consortium of nine Dutch cohorts with appropriate data available to the etiology of dementia, including an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline for data harmonization. Additionally, we assessed the challenges of transforming and standardizing cohort data using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) and evaluated our tool in one of the cohorts employing federated algorithms. RESULTS: We successfully applied our ETL tool and observed a complete coverage of the cohorts' data by the OMOP CDM. The OMOP CDM facilitated the data representation and standardization, but we identified limitations for cohort-specific data fields and in the scope of the vocabularies available. Specific challenges arise in a multi-cohort federated collaboration due to technical constraints in local environments, data heterogeneity, and lack of direct access to the data. CONCLUSION: In this article, we describe the solutions to these challenges and limitations encountered in our study. Our study shows the potential of federated learning as a privacy-preserving solution for multi-cohort studies that enhance reproducibility and reuse of both data and analyses.",Data harmonization and federated learning for multi-cohort dementia research using the OMOP common data model: A Netherlands consortium of dementia cohorts case study.,"['Humans', '*Dementia', 'Netherlands', 'Cohort Studies', 'Algorithms', 'Information Dissemination/methods', 'Biomedical Research']",,

MENDS-on-FHIR examined using Health Language Seven's Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7((R)) FHIR((R))) and US Core Implementation Guide (US Core IG) compliant resources derived from the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) to create a standards-based ETL pipeline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The input data source was a research data warehouse containing clinical and administrative data in OMOP CDM Version 5.3 format. OMOP-to-FHIR transformations, using a unique JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-to-JSON transformation language called Whistle, created FHIR R4 V4.0.1/US Core IG V4.0.0 conformant resources that were stored in a local FHIR server. A REST-based Bulk FHIR $export request extracted FHIR resources to populate a local MENDS database. RESULTS: Eleven OMOP tables were used to create 10 FHIR/US Core compliant resource types. A total of 1.13 trillion resources were extracted and inserted into the MENDS repository. A very low rate of non-compliant resources was observed. DISCUSSION: OMOP-to-FHIR transformation results passed validation with less than a 1% non-compliance rate. These standards-compliant FHIR resources provided standardized data elements required by the MENDS surveillance use case. The Bulk FHIR application programming interface (API) enabled population-level data exchange using interoperable FHIR resources. The OMOP-to-FHIR transformation pipeline creates a FHIR interface for accessing OMOP data. CONCLUSION: MENDS-on-FHIR successfully replaced custom ETL with standards-based interoperable FHIR resources using Bulk FHIR.

While container technology has significantly simplified deployments from a technical perspective, regulatory compliance can remain a major hurdle for the setup and operation of such platforms. In this paper, we present OHDSI-Compliance, a comprehensive set of document templates designed to streamline the data protection and information security-related documentation and coordination efforts required to establish OHDSI installations. METHODS: To decide on a set of relevant document templates, we first analyzed the legal requirements and associated guidelines with a focus on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Moreover, we analyzed the software architecture of a typical OHDSI stack and related its components to the different general types of concepts and documentation identified. Then, we created those documents for a prototypical OHDSI installation, based on the so-called Broadsea package, following relevant guidelines from Germany. Finally, we generalized the documents by introducing placeholders and options at places where individual institution-specific content will be needed. RESULTS: We present four documents: (1) a record of processing activities, (2) an information security concept, (3) an authorization concept, as well as (4) an operational concept covering the technical details of maintaining the stack. The documents are publicly available under a permissive license. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, there are no other publicly available sets of documents designed to simplify the compliance process for OHDSI deployments. While our documents provide a comprehensive starting point, local specifics need to be added, and, due to the heterogeneity of legal requirements in different countries, further adoptions might be necessary.",OHDSI-compliance: a set of document templates facilitating the implementation and operation of a software stack for real-world evidence generation.,,,

Yet, little is known about fatigue levels induced by treatment, which could interfere with rehabilitation outcomes. We analyzed fatigue experienced by people with chronic aphasia (>6 months) during high-dose interventions at 2 intensities. METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis was conducted on self-rated fatigue levels of people with chronic aphasia (N=173) collected during a previously published large randomized controlled trial of 2 treatments: constraint-induced aphasia therapy plus and multi-modality aphasia therapy. Interventions were administered at a higher intensity (30 hours over 2 weeks) or lower intensity (30 hours over 5 weeks). Participants rated their fatigue on an 11-point scale before and after each day of therapy. Data were analyzed using Bayesian ordinal multilevel models. Specifically, we considered changes in self-rated participant fatigue across a therapy day and over the intervention period. RESULTS: Data from 144 participants was analyzed. Participants were English speakers from Australia or New Zealand (mean age, 62 [range, 18-88] years) with 102 men and 42 women. Most had mild (n=115) or moderate (n=52) poststroke aphasia. Median ratings of the level of fatigue by people with aphasia were low (1 on a 0-10-point scale) at the beginning of the day. Ratings increased slightly (+1.0) each day after intervention, with marginally lower increases in the lower intensity schedule. There was no evidence of accumulating fatigue over the 2- or 5-week interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that intensive intervention was not associated with large increases in fatigue for people with chronic aphasia enrolled in the COMPARE trial (Constraint-Induced or Multimodality Personalised Aphasia Rehabilitation). Fatigue did not change across the course of the intervention. This study provides evidence that intensive treatment was minimally fatiguing for stroke survivors with chronic aphasia, suggesting that fatigue is not a barrier to high-intensity treatment.",High-Intensity Aphasia Intervention Is Minimally Fatiguing in Chronic Aphasia: An Analysis of Participant Self-Ratings From a Large Randomized Controlled Trial.,"['Humans', '*Aphasia/etiology/rehabilitation/therapy', 'Female', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Aged', '*Fatigue/etiology/therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Stroke/complications', 'Adolescent', 'Young Adult', 'Stroke Rehabilitation/methods', 'Self Report']",,

Sharing these data for research can help address unmet health needs, contribute to scientific breakthroughs, accelerate the development of more effective treatments and inform public health policy.

In addition, sharing sensitive data requires a secure and robust infrastructure with appropriate storage solutions. Here, we examine and compare the centralized and federated data sharing models through the prism of five large-scale and real-world use cases of strategic significance within the European data sharing landscape: the French Health Data Hub, the BBMRI-ERIC Colorectal Cancer Cohort, the federated European Genome-phenome Archive, the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership/OHDSI network and the EBRAINS Medical Informatics Platform. Our analysis indicates that centralized models facilitate data linkage, harmonization and interoperability, while federated models facilitate scaling up and legal compliance, as the data typically reside on the data generator's premises, allowing for better control of how data are shared.

For most cases, primary consideration should be given to systemic therapies as the first-line approach based on evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Despite the importance of RCTs as the pinnacle of evidence in modern medicine, concerns have been raised about their applicability to real-life scenarios. These trials often feature participants who are younger with better performance statuses and prognoses compared to their real-world counterparts. The PIONEER project falls under the Innovative Medicine Initiative's (IMI) ""Big Data for Better Outcomes"" initiative, aimed at revolutionizing PCa care in Europe. The central focus lies in improving cancer-related outcomes, enhancing health system efficiency, and elevating the quality of health and social care. This study endeavours to evaluate the generalizability of RCT findings concerning newly diagnosed metastatic PCa. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature will be conducted to compile patient characteristics from RCTs addressing this subject within the past decade. To create a real-world benchmark, patients with recently diagnosed metastatic PCa from a network of population-based databases will serve as a comparison group. The objective is to assess the applicability of RCT results in two ways. First, a comparison will be made between the characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic PCa enroled in RCTs and those with the same condition included in our databases which might represent the real-world setting. Second, an evaluation will be undertaken to determine the proportion of real-world patients with newly diagnosed metastatic PCa who meet the criteria for RCT enrolment. This study will rely on extensive observational data, primarily sourced from population-based registries, electronic health records, and insurance claims data. The study cohort is established upon routinely gathered healthcare data, meticulously mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model.","Research protocol for an observational health data analysis to assess the applicability of randomized controlled trials focusing on newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer using real-world data: PIONEER IMI's ""big data for better outcomes"" program.",,,

The OMOP CDM maintained by OHDSI is such a data model developed for a federated data analysis with partners from different institutions that want to jointly investigate research questions using clinical care data. The German Cancer Society as the scientific lead of the Prostate Cancer Outcomes (PCO) study gathers data from prostate cancer care including routine oncological care data and survey data (incl. patient-reported outcomes) and uses a common data specification (called OncoBox Research Prostate) for this purpose. To further enhance research collaborations outside the PCO study, the purpose of this article is to describe the process of transferring the PCO study data to the internationally well-established OMOP CDM. This process was carried out together with an IT company that specialised in supporting research institutions to transfer their data to OMOP CDM.

Despite the abundance of medical data across various facilities - including hospitals, outpatient clinics, and physician practices - the intersectoral exchange of information remains largely hindered due to differences in data structure, content, and adherence to data protection regulations. In response to this challenge, the Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) was launched in Germany, focusing initially on university hospitals to foster the exchange and utilization of real-world data through the development of standardized methods and tools, including the creation of a common core dataset. Our aim, as part of the Medical Informatics Research Hub in Saxony (MiHUBx), is to extend the MII concepts to non-university healthcare providers in a more seamless manner to enable the exchange of real-world data among intersectoral medical sites. METHODS: We investigated what services are needed to facilitate the provision of harmonized real-world data for cross-site research. On this basis, we designed a Service Platform Prototype that hosts services for data harmonization, adhering to the globally recognized Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) international standard communication format and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). Leveraging these standards, we implemented additional services facilitating data utilization, exchange and analysis. Throughout the development phase, we collaborated with an interdisciplinary team of experts from the fields of system administration, software engineering and technology acceptance to ensure that the solution is sustainable and reusable in the long term. RESULTS: We have developed the pre-built packages ""ResearchData-to-FHIR,"" ""FHIR-to-OMOP,"" and ""Addons,"" which provide the services for data harmonization and provision of project-related real-world data in both the FHIR MII Core dataset format (CDS) and the OMOP CDM format as well as utilization and a Service Platform Prototype to streamline data management and use. CONCLUSION: Our development shows a possible approach to extend the MII concepts to non-university healthcare providers to enable cross-site research on real-world data. Our Service Platform Prototype can thus pave the way for intersectoral data sharing, federated analysis, and provision of SMART-on-FHIR applications to support clinical decision making.",Streamlining intersectoral provision of real-world health data: a service platform for improved clinical research and patient care.,,,

We propose a highly available method which enables synthetic data generation from real patient records in a privacy preserving and compliant fashion, is interpretable and allows for expert intervention. METHODS: Our approach ties together two established tools in medical informatics, namely OMOP as a data standard for electronic health records and Synthea as a data synthetization method. For this study, data pipelines were built which extract data from OMOP, convert them into time series format, learn temporal rules by 2 statistical algorithms (Markov chain, TARM) and 3 algorithms of causal discovery (DYNOTEARS, J-PCMCI+, LiNGAM) and map the outputs into Synthea graphs. The graphs are evaluated quantitatively by their individual and relative complexity and qualitatively by medical experts. RESULTS: The algorithms were found to learn qualitatively and quantitatively different graph representations. Whereas the Markov chain results in extremely large graphs, TARM, DYNOTEARS, and J-PCMCI+ were found to reduce the data dimension during learning. The MultiGroupDirect LiNGAM algorithm was found to not be applicable to the problem statement at hand. CONCLUSION: Only TARM and DYNOTEARS are practical algorithms for real-world data in this use case. As causal discovery is a method to debias purely statistical relationships, the gradient-based causal discovery algorithm DYNOTEARS was found to be most suitable.",Learning debiased graph representations from the OMOP common data model for synthetic data generation.,"['Humans', '*Algorithms', '*Electronic Health Records/statistics & numerical data/standards', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical Informatics/methods/statistics & numerical data']",,

Our objective was to determine the predictability of 6-month retention in buprenorphine-naloxone treatment using electronic health record (EHR) data from diverse clinical settings and to identify key predictors. DESIGN: This retrospective observational study developed and validated machine learning-based clinical risk prediction models using EHR data. SETTING AND CASES: Data were sourced from Stanford University's healthcare system and Holmusk's NeuroBlu database, reflecting a wide range of healthcare settings. The study analyzed 1800 Stanford and 7957 NeuroBlu treatment encounters from 2008 to 2023 and from 2003 to 2023, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: Predict continuous prescription of buprenorphine-naloxone for at least 6 months, without a gap of more than 30 days. The performance of machine learning prediction models was assessed by area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) analysis as well as precision, recall and calibration. To further validate our approach's clinical applicability, we conducted two secondary analyses: a time-to-event analysis on a single site to estimate the duration of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment continuity evaluated by the C-index and a comparative evaluation against predictions made by three human clinical experts. FINDINGS: Attrition rates at 6 months were 58% (NeuroBlu) and 61% (Stanford). Prediction models trained and internally validated on NeuroBlu data achieved ROC-AUCs up to 75.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73.6-78.0). Addiction medicine specialists' predictions show a ROC-AUC of 67.8 (95% CI = 50.4-85.2). Time-to-event analysis on Stanford data indicated a median treatment retention time of 65 days, with random survival forest model achieving an average C-index of 65.9. The top predictor of treatment retention identified included the diagnosis of opioid dependence. CONCLUSIONS: US patients with opioid use disorder or opioid dependence treated with buprenorphine-naloxone prescriptions appear to have a high ( approximately 60%) treatment attrition by 6 months. Machine learning models trained on diverse electronic health record datasets appear to be able to predict treatment continuity with accuracy comparable to that of clinical experts.",Predictability of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment retention: A multi-site analysis combining electronic health records and machine learning.,,,

By offering a holistic perspective that accounts for the interactions among various objects, OCPM transcends the constraints of conventional patient-centric process mining approaches, ensuring a more detailed and inclusive understanding of healthcare dynamics. METHODS: We develop a novel method to transform the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Models (OMOP CDM) into Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs). First, an OMOP CDM4PM is created from the standard OMOP CDM, focusing on data relevant to generating OCEL and addressing healthcare data's heterogeneity and standardization challenges. Second, this subset is transformed into OCEL based on specified healthcare criteria, including identifying various object types, clinical activities, and their relationships. The methodology is tested on the MIMIC-IV database to evaluate its effectiveness and utility. RESULTS: Our proposed method effectively produces OCELs when applied to the MIMIC-IV dataset, allowing for the implementation of OCPM in the healthcare industry. We rigorously evaluate the comprehensiveness and level of abstraction to validate our approach's effectiveness. Additionally, we create diverse object-centric process models intricately designed to navigate the complexities inherent in healthcare processes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used temporal sequences of observational medical outcomes partnership common data model (OMOP CDM) concepts derived from an electronic health record as model features. Each concept was assigned an embedding representation that was learned from a graph convolution network trained on a knowledge graph (KG) of OMOP concept relationships. Concept embeddings were fed into long short-term memory networks for 1-year adverse event prediction following drug exposure. Finally, we implemented a novel extension of the local interpretable model agnostic explanation (LIME) method, knowledge graph LIME (KG-LIME) to leverage the KG and explain individual predictions of each model. RESULTS: For a set of 4859 patients, we found that our model was effective at predicting 32 out of 56 adverse event types (P < .05) when compared to demographics and past diagnosis as variables. We also assessed discrimination in the form of area under the curve (AUC = 0.77 +/- 0.15) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR = 0.31 +/- 0.27) and assessed calibration in the form of Brier score (BS = 0.04 +/- 0.04). Additionally, KG-LIME generated interpretable literature-validated lists of relevant medical concepts used for prediction. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Many of our risk models demonstrated high calibration and discrimination for adverse event prediction. Furthermore, our novel KG-LIME method was able to utilize the knowledge graph to highlight concepts that were important to prediction.

However, in real-world clinical practice, patients visit different hospitals seeking various medical services, resulting in fragmented patient data across hospitals. With data security issues, data fragmentation limits the application of knowledge graphs because single-hospital data cannot provide complete evidence for generating precise decision support and comprehensive explanations. It is important to study new methods for knowledge graph systems to integrate into multicenter, information-sensitive medical environments, using fragmented patient records for decision support while maintaining data privacy and security. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to propose an electronic health record (EHR)-oriented knowledge graph system for collaborative reasoning with multicenter fragmented patient medical data, all the while preserving data privacy. METHODS: The study introduced an EHR knowledge graph framework and a novel collaborative reasoning process for utilizing multicenter fragmented information. The system was deployed in each hospital and used a unified semantic structure and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) vocabulary to standardize the local EHR data set. The system transforms local EHR data into semantic formats and performs semantic reasoning to generate intermediate reasoning findings. The generated intermediate findings used hypernym concepts to isolate original medical data. The intermediate findings and hash-encrypted patient identities were synchronized through a blockchain network. The multicenter intermediate findings were collaborated for final reasoning and clinical decision support without gathering original EHR data. RESULTS: The system underwent evaluation through an application study involving the utilization of multicenter fragmented EHR data to alert non-nephrology clinicians about overlooked patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study covered 1185 patients in nonnephrology departments from 3 hospitals. The patients visited at least two of the hospitals. Of these, 124 patients were identified as meeting CKD diagnosis criteria through collaborative reasoning using multicenter EHR data, whereas the data from individual hospitals alone could not facilitate the identification of CKD in these patients. The assessment by clinicians indicated that 78/91 (86%) patients were CKD positive.
