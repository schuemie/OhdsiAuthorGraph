Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of two methods, LGPS and LEOPARD, for detecting and filtering drug safety signals in longitudinal databases. This involves the use of statistical methods and the application of these methods to observational medical data. The publication also discusses the performance of these methods in a competition for signal detection methods. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of methodological research, as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches. It does not seem to directly involve the maintenance of data standards, the creation of software tools, or the conduction of network studies to test clinical hypotheses.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
