Discussion: The publication discusses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership, a public-private partnership that aims to advance the science of active medical product safety surveillance using existing observational databases. This involves studying governance, data resource, and methodological issues and their interrelationships in establishing a viable national program of active drug safety surveillance. This suggests that the publication could fall under the categories of "Methodological research" and "Clinical evidence generation". However, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the development and evaluation of methods for active surveillance, which aligns more closely with "Methodological research".

Final category: 2. Methodological research
