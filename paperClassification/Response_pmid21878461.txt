Discussion: The publication focuses on the application of disproportionality methods for pharmacovigilance in longitudinal observational databases (LOD). It systematically explores the use of statistical methods (e.g., PRR, ROR, EBGM, IC) to identify drug safety signals in LODs, which are a newer data source compared to spontaneous report system databases. This exploration involves evaluating the performance of these methods in both simulated and real-world data, addressing computational challenges and methodological considerations. Given the emphasis on evaluating and adapting analytic approaches for a specific type of data source, the publication aligns most closely with **methodological research**, as it seeks to determine scientific best practices in applying disproportionality methods to LODs.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
