Discussion: The publication discusses the validation of a common data model (CDM) for active safety surveillance research. It involves the translation of data from various data models to a common data model to facilitate analysis and understanding. The authors also tested the model's suitability for large-scale systematic analysis by loading data from different observational healthcare databases into separate instances of the model. This work is primarily focused on the development and validation of a standardized data model, which aligns with the first category of OHDSI's collaboration categories - Open community data standards. 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
