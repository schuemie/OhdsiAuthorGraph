Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of mapping tables to convert ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes to SNOMED-CT and MedDRA, which are standardized vocabularies. This work is aimed at addressing the lack of standardization in clinical terminologies across different healthcare databases. The study also evaluates the impact of vocabulary mapping on various aspects such as the retention of clinical data, the semantic space of outcome definitions, the prevalence of each outcome, and the reliability of analytic methods for detecting drug-outcome associations. This work falls under the scope of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. Therefore, it can be categorized under "Open community data standards". However, it also touches on aspects of methodological research as it evaluates the impact of the mapping on the reliability of analytic methods. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the development and application of standardized vocabularies, which is a key aspect of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
