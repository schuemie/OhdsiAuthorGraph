Discussion: This publication focuses on the development of a framework for assessing data quality in electronic health record-based clinical research, particularly in multisite studies. The emphasis is on ensuring that data are "fit-for-use" and on creating standardized approaches for data quality assessment. This aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and improving the standards for data quality within the OHDSI community. While the framework could indirectly support clinical evidence generation by ensuring high-quality data for studies, the primary focus is on the processes and methodologies for assessing and improving data quality. Therefore, the publication is most relevant to the category of **Open community data standards**, as it contributes to the conventions and practices for ensuring data quality in the context of the OMOP common data model and related standards.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
