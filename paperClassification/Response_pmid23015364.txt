Discussion: The publication discusses the performance of eight analytic methods for estimating the strength of association-relative risk (RR) and associated standard error of 53 drug-adverse event outcome pairs. It involves the application of these methods to a network of ten observational healthcare databases. The study is focused on the development and evaluation of statistical methods for identifying adverse events associated with medical products. This falls under the scope of methodological research as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches. It does not directly involve the maintenance of the OMOP common data model or OHDSI standardized vocabularies (category 1), nor does it involve the creation of software tools (category 3). It also does not directly involve conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses (category 4).

Final category: 2. Methodological research
