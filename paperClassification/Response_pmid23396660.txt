Discussion: The publication discusses the application of standardized drug terminologies to observational healthcare databases, using opioids as an example. It evaluates three drug classification systems and their impact on prevalence in the analysis of observational healthcare databases. The study also emphasizes the need for transparent and reproducible research publications, suggesting the inclusion of a description of the process used to develop code sets and the complete code set used in studies. This work aligns with the first category, "Open community data standards", as it involves the use of the OMOP Common Data Model vocabulary and the standardization of terminologies for observational healthcare databases. It also touches on the third category, "Open source development", as it discusses the need for reproducibility in research. However, the main focus is on the standardization of drug terminologies, which falls under the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
