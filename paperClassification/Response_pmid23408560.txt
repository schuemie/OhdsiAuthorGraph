Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a visualization tool to explore parameter settings that may enhance predictive properties for a given method in a database. This tool is used to assess the performance of methods for safety surveillance using electronic databases. The tool is used to explore design and analysis options of methods for evaluating a variety of drug-outcome relationships and also to explore data issues. This falls under the development of analytic approaches and tools, which is a characteristic of both methodological research and open source development. However, the focus is more on the development and evaluation of the analytic approach (the visualization tool), rather than the creation of a software tool for community use.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
