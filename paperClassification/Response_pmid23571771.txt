Discussion: The publication discusses the performance of signal-detection algorithms (SDAs) in pharmacovigilance, specifically in the context of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. The study evaluates the diagnostic potential and characteristics of these algorithms, providing insights into their predictive accuracy and suggesting ways to optimize their use. This falls under the scope of methodological research as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches. It does not directly involve the OMOP common data model or OHDSI standardized vocabularies (category 1), nor does it involve the creation of software tools (category 3). While it does touch on the generation of clinical evidence, the primary focus is on the methodology of signal detection, not on the results of specific clinical studies (category 4).

Final category: 2. Methodological research
