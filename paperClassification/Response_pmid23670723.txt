Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating case definitions for acute liver injury (ALI) across multiple observational databases. The study aims to improve the understanding of ALI prevalence and natural history, as well as to refine case definitions for better identification of ALI in observational research. The work involves analyzing clinical and laboratory characteristics, assessing heterogeneity in testing patterns, and exploring the implications for drug-induced liver injury (DILI). While the study contributes to methodological considerations (e.g., refining case definitions), its primary focus is on generating clinical evidence about ALI prevalence, natural history, and variability in clinical features across databases. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study seeks to produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization.
