Discussion: This publication discusses the need for empirical calibration in interpreting observational studies, particularly in the context of drug safety studies. The authors argue that bias and confounding in observational studies can undermine the common premise of 'p < 0.05' indicating statistical significance. They propose a method of empirical calibration to correct p-values, which they demonstrate reduces spurious results. This work is primarily focused on developing and evaluating an analytic approach, which aligns with the category of methodological research. While it does touch on issues related to clinical evidence generation, the main focus is on the methodology itself rather than the generation of specific clinical evidence.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
