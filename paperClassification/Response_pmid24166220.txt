Discussion: The publication discusses the variation in study design choices made by researchers using observational data to understand drug effects. It highlights the lack of consistency in method and analysis choices even when addressing the same research question in the same database. The paper suggests the need for empirical evidence to inform these decisions and promote a better understanding of the impact of standardization on research implementation. This suggests that the paper is primarily concerned with the methodological aspects of research, including the design and analysis of studies. Therefore, it seems to fall under the category of "Methodological research". However, it also touches on the need for standardization, which could potentially place it in the "Open community data standards" category. Nevertheless, the main focus of the paper is on the methodological choices made by researchers, rather than on the standards themselves.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
