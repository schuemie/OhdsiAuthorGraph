Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the empirical performance of the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design, a statistical method for risk identification in observational healthcare data. The study examines design choices, evaluates predictive performance, and identifies strengths and limitations of the SCCS approach. The emphasis is on developing and assessing analytic methods for risk identification, which aligns with methodological research aimed at determining scientific best practices in statistics and epidemiology. While the study uses real-world databases and generates evidence, its primary focus is on evaluating and improving the methodology rather than generating clinical evidence directly. Therefore, the most appropriate category is **Methodological research**.
