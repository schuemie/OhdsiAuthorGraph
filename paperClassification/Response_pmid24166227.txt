Discussion: The publication discusses the evaluation of the self-controlled cohort method as a tool for risk identification in observational healthcare data. It involves the application of this method to various drug-outcome scenarios in real observational databases and simulated datasets. The performance of the method is then evaluated through various metrics. This falls under the development and evaluation of analytic approaches, which is characteristic of methodological research. While the study does involve the use of observational healthcare data, it does not specifically discuss the maintenance of the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, or community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, which would be characteristic of open community data standards. Similarly, while the study does involve the use of a specific method, it does not discuss the creation of software tools to enable the community to execute analyses, which would be characteristic of open source development. Finally, while the study does involve the analysis of drug-outcome scenarios, it does not specifically involve the testing of clinical hypotheses or the production of evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, which would be characteristic of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
