Discussion: The publication focuses on evaluating the performance of disproportionality analysis methods, which are commonly used for safety signaling in spontaneous reporting systems, when applied to healthcare databases. The study involves testing these methods across multiple real-world and simulated datasets, assessing their predictive accuracy, statistical properties, and ability to distinguish true effects from false findings. This type of research is primarily concerned with the empirical evaluation of analytic approaches and statistical methods to determine their suitability and reliability for adverse drug reaction risk identification in healthcare data. Therefore, the publication aligns most closely with the **Methodological research** category, as it seeks to advance scientific best practices in epidemiology and informatics.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
