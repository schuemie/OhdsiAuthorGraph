Discussion: This publication focuses on the empirical evaluation of statistical methods (LGPS and LEOPARD) for drug safety monitoring using large-scale observational healthcare data. The study assesses the operating characteristics, predictive accuracy, bias, and confidence interval properties of these methods. The primary goal is to determine the suitability of these methods for risk identification and analysis, which aligns with methodological research aimed at evaluating and improving analytic approaches in epidemiology and statistics. While the study uses observational healthcare data, its focus is not on generating clinical evidence but rather on assessing the performance of statistical methods.

Final category: **2. Methodological research**
