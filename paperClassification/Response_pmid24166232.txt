Discussion: The publication discusses the replication of the OMOP experiment in European EHR databases. It involves the evaluation of statistical methods and analysis choices for risk identification in longitudinal observational healthcare data. This falls under the methodological research category as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches. It does not directly involve the maintenance of the OMOP common data model or OHDSI standardized vocabularies, which would fall under the open community data standards category. It also does not involve the creation of software tools, which would fall under the open source development category. Lastly, while it does involve the use of EHR databases for risk identification, it does not directly involve conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses or produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, which would fall under the clinical evidence generation category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
