Discussion: The publication discusses the design, evaluation, and application of a probabilistic framework (OSIM2) for generating simulated observational healthcare data. This data is then used to evaluate the performance of various observational designs in identifying associations between drug exposure and health outcomes. The focus of the paper is on the development and empirical evaluation of this statistical method, which falls under the scope of methodological research. While the paper also touches on the generation of clinical evidence, the primary focus is on the methodological approach itself, rather than the clinical findings it produces.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
