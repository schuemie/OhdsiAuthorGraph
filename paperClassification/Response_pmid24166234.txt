Discussion: The publication discusses a study on the effect of different definitions of Health Outcomes of Interest (HOI) on the performance of analytical methods in observational outcome studies. The authors have used different definitions for three HOIs and studied their impact on the performance of various analytical methods in four observational healthcare databases. This involves a significant amount of methodological research, as it involves developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches. The study does not seem to directly involve the maintenance of the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, or community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. It also does not appear to involve the creation of software tools. While the study does involve the generation of clinical evidence, its primary focus seems to be on the methodological aspects of defining HOIs and their impact on the performance of analytical methods.
