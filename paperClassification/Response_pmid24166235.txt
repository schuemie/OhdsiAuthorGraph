Discussion: The publication discusses a systematic risk identification system for studying all marketed drugs. It evaluates the feasibility of this system based on commercially available observational databases, the range of drugs that can be studied for certain outcomes, the influence of underpowered drug-outcome pairs on the performance of analytical methods estimating the strength of their association, and the time required from the introduction of a new drug to accumulate sufficient data for signal detection. This involves the development and evaluation of analytical methods, which falls under methodological research. However, it also involves the generation of clinical evidence regarding the impact of drug and outcome prevalence on the feasibility and performance of these methods, which falls under clinical evidence generation. While the publication touches on both categories, it seems to focus more on the development and evaluation of the analytical methods, making methodological research the most appropriate category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
