Discussion: The publication "Medication-wide association studies" focuses on using electronic healthcare databases to identify potential side effects of drugs through a novel analytic approach. The study involves multivariate analysis and exploratory visualization to assess associations between medications and health outcomes. This aligns with the **methodological research** category, as the work is centered on developing and evaluating analytic techniques for studying drug safety and associations in observational data. While the study generates clinical insights, its primary contribution is methodological, as it explores the strengths and limitations of observational databases and analytic approaches for identifying associations rather than directly producing clinical evidence.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
