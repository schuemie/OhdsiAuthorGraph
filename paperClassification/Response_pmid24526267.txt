Discussion: This publication focuses on conducting retrospective analyses across two large healthcare databases to investigate the association between oral fluoroquinolone exposure and retinal detachment. The study involves replicating findings from a prior study, applying different statistical methods (case-control and self-controlled case-series analyses), and generating evidence about the safety of fluoroquinolones. The primary goal is to produce clinical evidence regarding the potential risks associated with fluoroquinolone use, which aligns with the OHDSI collaboration category of "Clinical evidence generation." While the study employs methodological approaches, its focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies but rather on applying established methods to answer a clinical question. Similarly, the study does not involve open community data standards or open-source software development.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
