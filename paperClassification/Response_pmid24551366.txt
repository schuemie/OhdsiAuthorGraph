Discussion: The publication discusses the comparison of three large Integrated Data Repositories (IDRs) including the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) repository. The focus is on identifying common architectural features that enable efficient storage and organization of large amounts of clinical data. This involves the analysis of underlying data storage models, representation of sample facts in each repository, and the development of a list of desiderata for IDRs. This work is closely related to the maintenance and improvement of data standards and models, which is a key aspect of the "Open community data standards" category. Although it touches on aspects of "Open source development" in terms of discussing the architecture of these repositories, the main focus is on the data standards and models, not the development of software tools.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
