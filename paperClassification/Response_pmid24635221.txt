Discussion: The publication discusses the benefits and challenges of combining multiple healthcare databases for postmarketing drug and vaccine safety surveillance. It highlights the need for harmonization of medical data extraction through homogeneous coding algorithms across different databases, dealing with privacy issues, and developing a proper remote research environment for data storage and access. This involves aspects of open community data standards, such as maintaining the OMOP common data model and standardized vocabularies. However, the main focus is on the methodological research to develop and evaluate approaches for combining databases and managing data privacy. It also touches on clinical evidence generation as it aims to improve postmarketing drug and vaccine safety surveillance.
