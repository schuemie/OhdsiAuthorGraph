Discussion: The publication discusses the development of an open-source standardized knowledge base for the effects of medical products. This involves the integration and standardization of information from various electronic sources pertinent to drug safety. The goal is to make it easier for practitioners to access, retrieve, and synthesize evidence for a rigorous and accurate assessment of causal relationships between a given drug and health outcomes of interest (HOIs). This work aligns with the open community data standards category as it involves maintaining and standardizing vocabularies and data. However, it also touches on methodological research as the knowledge base will enable more advanced methodological research that empirically evaluates the performance of drug safety analysis methods. Despite this, the primary focus of the publication is on the development of the knowledge base, which is a tool for standardizing and integrating data.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
