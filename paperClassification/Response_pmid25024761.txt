Discussion: This publication presents a method for comparing clinical trial target populations with patient populations in electronic health records, using Type 2 diabetes as an example. The method is used to assess the generalizability of clinical trials and to define population-representative clinical trial eligibility criteria. This work involves the use of electronic health records and the development of a new method, which suggests it could fall under the categories of open community data standards or methodological research. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and application of a new method, rather than on the data standards themselves. Therefore, it seems more appropriate to classify this publication under methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
