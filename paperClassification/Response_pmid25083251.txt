Discussion: The publication discusses the impact of different study designs and analytic choices on the results of clinical studies using observational databases. It emphasizes the need for more attention to how design choices may impact results and suggests that investigators should examine a wide array of possible choices to confirm that significant findings are consistently identified. This falls under the methodological research category as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics, epidemiology, and informatics.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
