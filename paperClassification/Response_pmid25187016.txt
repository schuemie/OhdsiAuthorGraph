Discussion: The publication discusses the process of converting the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). It details the extraction, transformation, and loading process, including source code mappings, Read code domain classification, an imputation algorithm for drug duration, and special handling of lifestyle/clinical data. The paper also assesses the completeness and accuracy of these elements and validates the transformation by replicating a published case-control study. This falls under the work of maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment, which is part of the open community data standards category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
