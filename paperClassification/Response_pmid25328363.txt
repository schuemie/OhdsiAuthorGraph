Discussion: The publication focuses on the optimization and parallelization of statistical computation methods, specifically cyclic coordinate descent approaches for fitting generalized linear models in large-scale observational databases. The emphasis is on improving computational efficiency and enabling complex statistical methods in drug safety research. This aligns closely with **methodological research**, as the paper develops and evaluates analytic approaches to address computational and statistical challenges in observational data analysis. While the work may indirectly support clinical evidence generation by enabling faster and more robust analyses, the primary focus is on advancing statistical methodology and computational techniques.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
