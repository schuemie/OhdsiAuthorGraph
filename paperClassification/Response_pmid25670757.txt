Discussion: The publication discusses the application of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) across multiple observational databases. It evaluates the extent of information loss that occurred through the standardization process and the utility of standardized analytics tools for conducting observational research. The paper also discusses the improvement in data quality, increased efficiency, and facilitated cross-database comparisons as a result of the standardization process. This suggests that the paper is primarily concerned with the use and benefits of data standards in observational health databases. Therefore, it seems to align most closely with the "Open community data standards" category. While there is some element of methodological research in evaluating the utility of the CDM, the primary focus is on the application and benefits of the data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
