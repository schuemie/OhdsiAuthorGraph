Discussion: This publication discusses the development and validation of a method for classifying severity at the phenotype-level from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The method, CAESAR, uses a random forest algorithm and multiple severity measures to differentiate between severe and mild phenotypes. This work involves the creation of a new tool that can be used to extract and analyze data from EHRs, which falls under the category of open source development. However, it also involves methodological research as it develops and empirically evaluates a new analytic approach. While the tool could potentially be used in clinical evidence generation, the paper itself does not conduct any network studies or produce any clinical evidence. Therefore, the most appropriate categories for this publication are open source development and methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
