Discussion: The publication primarily focuses on the infrastructure and business model of the DARTNet Institute, which supports clinical data research networks. It emphasizes the mechanisms for extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from electronic health records (EHRs), as well as the development of a sustainable infrastructure for clinical data research activities. This aligns closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as it involves maintaining and supporting the infrastructure necessary for data standardization and ETL processes. While the paper also touches on enabling clinical evidence generation through observational studies and pragmatic trials, the core focus is on the infrastructure and business model that supports these activities, rather than the direct generation of clinical evidence itself.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
