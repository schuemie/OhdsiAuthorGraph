Discussion: The publication discusses the impact of applying a standardized revenue code-based logic for defining inpatient encounters across two different claims databases. It shows how the use of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) with a standardized approach for defining inpatient visits can decrease the heterogeneity observed in disease prevalence estimates across two different claims data sources. This falls under the work of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. Therefore, it is related to the category of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
