Discussion: The publication discusses the comparison of two common data models (CDMs) - Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) and Mini-Sentinel - in the context of drug safety surveillance. It evaluates the usability and interpretation of results based on these CDMs and the impact of different analytical methods on the results. This involves the transformation of data into these CDMs, comparison of data at the patient level, and the construction of study cohorts. The paper also discusses the impact of differences in the implementation of the high-dimensional propensity score (HDPS) procedure on the performance of the OMOP CDM. This suggests that the paper is primarily concerned with data standards and methodologies for data analysis in the context of drug safety surveillance. Therefore, it could potentially fall under both the "Open community data standards" and "Methodological research" categories. However, given that the main focus of the paper is on the comparison and evaluation of different CDMs and analytical methods, it seems more appropriate to classify it under the "Methodological research" category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
