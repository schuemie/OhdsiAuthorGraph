Discussion: The publication discusses a new method for detecting negative side effects using observational data, which involves using a set of causality considerations developed by the epidemiologist Bradford Hill. This method is designed to better discriminate between causal and non-causal relationships, which is a common issue with existing methods. The paper also discusses the use of supervised learning to automate the Bradford Hill's causality assessment. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of methodological research, as it involves the development and evaluation of a new analytic approach. It does not seem to involve the maintenance of data standards, the creation of software tools, or the conduction of network studies, which are the focuses of the other categories.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
