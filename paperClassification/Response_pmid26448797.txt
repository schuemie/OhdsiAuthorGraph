Discussion: The publication discusses the process of transforming two health system databases into the OMOP CDM, and the subsequent development of cohorts for comparative effectiveness use case examples. This involves the use of standardized vocabularies and conventions for ETL processes, which aligns with the "Open community data standards" category. However, the paper also touches on the generation of clinical evidence through the use of these transformed databases for comparative effectiveness analyses, which falls under the "Clinical evidence generation" category. Despite this, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the adoption and implementation of the OMOP CDM, rather than the results of the comparative effectiveness analyses themselves.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
