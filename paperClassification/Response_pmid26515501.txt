Discussion: The publication discusses an approach to integrate EHRs from different sources and generate data in different formats or semantics to support various clinical research applications. This involves mapping data from different EHR systems to RDF data with source semantics, and then converting to representations with harmonized domain semantics. This process improves reusability and supports different clinical research settings. The publication also mentions the use of domain ontologies and terminologies, and the conversion of data to application semantics. This falls under the creation of data standards and conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, which is part of the "Open community data standards" category. However, the publication also involves the development of a new approach or method for semantic processing of EHR data, which falls under the "Methodological research" category. 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
