Discussion: The publication discusses a method for normalizing laboratory results from different data sources by adjusting for heterogeneous clinico-epidemiologic characteristics of the data. This method, called subgroup-adjusted normalization (SAN), is designed to facilitate the analysis of data integrated across distributed research network (DRN) partners for retrospective observational studies. The paper presents an evaluation of the performance of SAN compared to existing methods using both simulated and real datasets. This work falls under the development and evaluation of analytic approaches, which is part of methodological research. It does not directly involve the maintenance of data standards, the creation of software tools, or the generation of clinical evidence.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
