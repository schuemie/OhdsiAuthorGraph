Discussion: The publication discusses the misclassification of drug-event associations in the OMOP database, which is a part of the OHDSI project. It critically evaluates the criteria used to classify positive and negative controls and suggests improvements to the OMOP. This involves an analysis of the data standards and conventions used in the OMOP, which falls under the category of "Open community data standards". However, it also involves a methodological evaluation of the classification process, which falls under the category of "Methodological research". While both categories could potentially apply, the main focus of the paper is on the evaluation and improvement of the classification process, which suggests that "Methodological research" is the most appropriate category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
