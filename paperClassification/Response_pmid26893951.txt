Discussion: The publication discusses the process of converting Electronic Health Records (EHR) to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Common Data Model (CDM). It involves the transformation of EHR codes into the standard vocabulary of the CDM and the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data into the CDM structure. The publication also discusses the use of the open-source data characterization program ACHILLES to validate and improve the quality of the transformed dataset. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
