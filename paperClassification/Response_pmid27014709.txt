Discussion: The publication discusses the use of existing observational data for health care research, focusing on the comparison of different strategies for data extraction and management in observational health care databases. It presents a conceptual framework for local data processing and applies it to four case studies. This involves the reorganization of data into a common structure, the derivation of study variables not present in original data, and the application of study design to transform longitudinal data into aggregated data sets for statistical analysis. This falls under the development and maintenance of data standards and conventions, which is characteristic of the "Open community data standards" category. However, it also involves methodological research in the form of developing a conceptual framework and applying it to case studies, which falls under the "Methodological research" category. The publication does not seem to involve the creation of software tools or the conduction of network studies, so the "Open source development" and "Clinical evidence generation" categories do not seem to apply.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
