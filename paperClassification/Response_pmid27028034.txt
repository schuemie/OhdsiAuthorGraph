Discussion: The publication discusses a mixed-method pilot study aimed at catalyzing change in primary care training. The study involves the development and evaluation of a professional development program designed to prepare faculty to accelerate change in primary care residency training. The focus of the publication is on the methodological approach to the study and the evaluation of its outcomes. Therefore, it does not directly relate to the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, or community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, which are the focus of the "Open community data standards" category. It also does not involve the creation of software tools, which is the focus of the "Open source development" category. While the study does involve the generation of clinical evidence, its primary focus is not on testing clinical hypotheses or producing evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization. Instead, the study is centered on the development and evaluation of a methodological approach to improving primary care training. Therefore, the publication is most closely aligned with the "Methodological research" category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
