Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing health care claims databases to investigate a potential seasonal pattern in hospitalizations for acute liver injury (ALI). The study uses statistical methods to test for seasonality and validates its approach with positive and negative controls. While the study employs methodological tools, its primary aim is to address a clinical hypothesis about the relationship between acetaminophen use and ALI during cold/flu seasons. This aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the research seeks to characterize disease patterns and produce evidence related to treatment utilization and outcomes.
