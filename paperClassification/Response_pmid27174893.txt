Discussion: This publication focuses on developing statistical models for phenotyping using machine learning techniques and noisy labeled training data. The study explores the feasibility of using semi-automatically labeled data to train models for identifying phenotypes, which is a methodological approach to improve electronic phenotyping. The emphasis is on evaluating the performance of these models and comparing them to rule-based definitions, which aligns with the goal of advancing analytic approaches and determining best practices in informatics and statistics. While the study indirectly contributes to clinical evidence generation by improving phenotype identification, its primary focus is on the methodological aspect of creating and validating machine learning models for phenotyping.
