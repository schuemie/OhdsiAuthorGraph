Discussion: This publication focuses on curating and standardizing the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) data, which involves cleaning, normalizing, and mapping data to standardized vocabularies (RxNorm and SNOMED-CT). The goal is to improve the quality of the data and enable standardized analyses for drug safety research. This aligns with the **Open community data standards** category, as it involves maintaining and enhancing standardized vocabularies and conventions for data quality assessment. While the resource and source code provided could also be seen as contributing to **Open source development**, the primary focus is on the curation and standardization of data, which is foundational to the community's data standards.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
