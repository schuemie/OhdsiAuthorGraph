Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OHDSI network to characterize treatment pathways for various diseases using observational research. This involves the use of large, diverse populations and the mapping of all data to common data standards. The study also maintains patient privacy through a distributed model and aggregates results centrally. This suggests that the publication could fall under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of common data standards and the maintenance of data quality. However, the publication also involves the generation of clinical evidence through observational research, which suggests it could also fall under the category of "Clinical evidence generation". 

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
