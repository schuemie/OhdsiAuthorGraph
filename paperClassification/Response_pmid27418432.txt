Discussion: This publication discusses the results of the Observational Medical Outcomes Research Partnership (OMOP) 2010 Experiment, focusing on the design and analysis choices for safety surveillance evaluations. The authors scrutinize the results of the experiment, particularly those that produced unexpected results, and suggest that one cause of reproducible "error" may be the failure to tie design choices closely enough to the research question at hand. This suggests that the publication is primarily concerned with the development and evaluation of analytic approaches, which falls under the category of methodological research. However, the focus on safety surveillance evaluations also suggests a connection to the generation of clinical evidence. Despite this, the primary focus of the publication appears to be on the methodology used in the experiment, rather than the generation of clinical evidence itself.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
