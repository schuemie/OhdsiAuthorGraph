Discussion: This publication discusses the development of an algorithm that links epidemiological data from birth month studies with genetic data from published gene-disease association studies. The algorithm uses existing data repositories to produce a network that connects seasonally varying biofactors with birth month dependent diseases through their overlapping developmental gene sets. This work involves the use of informatics and statistical methods to analyze data and generate clinical evidence. Therefore, it could potentially fall under the categories of methodological research and clinical evidence generation. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and application of the algorithm, which is a methodological approach to analyze data and generate evidence. Therefore, the most appropriate category would be methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
