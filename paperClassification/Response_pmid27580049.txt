Discussion: The publication discusses a novel standard data derivation procedure tested in a set of heterogeneous data sources, with the identification of subjects with type 2 diabetes as the test case. The study involves the use of a shared event definition, the generation of standard algorithms, and the use of the Unified Medical Language System for semantic harmonization within data domains. This suggests that the publication is primarily concerned with the development and application of standards and conventions for handling and analyzing healthcare data. Therefore, it seems to align most closely with the "Open community data standards" category. However, the study also involves some elements of methodological research, as it involves the development and testing of a new approach to identifying cases of a particular condition in healthcare data. 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
