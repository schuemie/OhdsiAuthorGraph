Discussion: The publication focuses on harmonizing data quality assessment terminology and creating a conceptual framework for evaluating the quality of electronic health record (EHR) data. It emphasizes the development of standardized terms, definitions, and categories to assess whether data is fit for specific uses. This work aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and improving community standards for data quality assessment, which is a key aspect of the **Open community data standards** category. While the publication does not directly involve methodological research, open-source software development, or clinical evidence generation, it provides foundational tools and frameworks that support the broader OHDSI community in ensuring data quality.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
