Discussion: The publication discusses the incidence of exposure of patients to multiple drugs for which pharmacogenomic guidelines are available. It suggests that pre-emptive pharmacogenomic testing could be beneficial and cost-effective, especially for patients who are likely to be exposed to multiple such drugs. The study uses patient records to identify and quantify the incidence of pharmacotherapy that could be impacted by pre-emptive pharmacogenomic testing. This falls under the category of clinical evidence generation as it involves conducting a study to produce evidence related to the utilization of medical interventions (in this case, pharmacogenomic testing and drug use). It does not seem to involve the development of new methodologies, software tools, or data standards.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
