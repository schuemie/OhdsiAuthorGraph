Discussion: The publication discusses the process of converting electronic health data from multiple nursing facilities into a research quality longitudinal dataset using OHDSI's open-source tools. This process involves extracting, translating, and loading the data into the OHDSI common data model. The paper also discusses the use of the Achilles data characterization tool for quality assurance. This falls under the category of Open community data standards as it involves the use of the OMOP common data model and OHDSI standardized vocabularies. However, it also touches on Open source development as it utilizes open-source tools developed by OHDSI. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the process of standardizing and ensuring the quality of the data, which is more aligned with the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
