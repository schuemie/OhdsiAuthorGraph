Discussion: The publication discusses the evaluation of common data models (CDMs) for sharing data from a large, longitudinal, electronic health record (EHR)-based community registry. The authors compared four CDMs, including the OMOP model, against 11 criteria in six categories. The results showed that the OMOP CDM best met the criteria for supporting data sharing from longitudinal EHR-based studies. This publication is primarily focused on data standards and their application in a specific context, which aligns with the first category of OHDSI's collaboration categories: Open community data standards. Although there is an element of methodological research in the evaluation process, the main focus is on the data standards themselves and their suitability for a specific use case.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
