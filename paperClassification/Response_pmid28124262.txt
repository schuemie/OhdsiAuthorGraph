Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the risks of acute kidney injury (AKI) and related outcomes among older adults using atypical antipsychotics (AAPs). It involves a replication analysis of a previous study and an evaluation of adapted confounding control strategies. The study uses statistical methods, such as propensity score matching and adjusted analyses, to assess the impact of methodological approaches on the observed associations. The emphasis on comparing analytic approaches and addressing confounding by indication suggests that the publication is primarily concerned with methodological research. While the study generates clinical evidence about the risks associated with AAPs, its primary focus is on evaluating and refining analytic methods, which aligns with the goals of methodological research.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
