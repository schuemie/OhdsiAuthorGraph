Discussion: The publication discusses the feasibility of representing nursing research data using the OMOP Common Data Model. This involves mapping unique data items from nursing articles to the OMOP CDM and identifying potential information loss in certain areas. This work is related to maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. Therefore, it falls under the category of "Open community data standards". Although the study also touches on the development of metadata for data discovery, the main focus is on the use and potential improvement of the OMOP CDM, which is a data standard.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
