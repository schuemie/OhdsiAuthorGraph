Discussion: The publication discusses the development of an open-source information extraction system, EliIE, which is designed to parse and formalize free-text clinical research eligibility criteria. The system follows the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) version 5.0. The paper also discusses the steps involved in parsing the eligibility criteria, the recruitment of informaticians and domain experts to design an annotation guideline, and the generation of a training corpus of annotated eligibility criteria. The paper also presents the results of task-specific evaluations of the system. This publication seems to fall under both the "Open community data standards" and "Open source development" categories. It discusses the use of the OMOP CDM, which is a part of the open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development of the EliIE system, which is an open-source tool, thus falling under the "Open source development" category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
