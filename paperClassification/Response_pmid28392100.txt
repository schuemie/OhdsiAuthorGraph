Discussion: This publication focuses on risk prediction for ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) in patients without atrial fibrillation (AF). It evaluates the performance of existing predictive models (CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc) using retrospective cohort data from multiple healthcare databases. The study involves the application of statistical methods to assess predictive accuracy and suggests areas for improvement in the models. This aligns with the goals of methodological research, which involves developing and evaluating analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics and epidemiology. While the study generates clinical evidence about stroke risk, its primary focus is on evaluating and improving predictive models, making it more aligned with methodological research than clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
