Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by conducting a network study to compare the incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with SGLT2 inhibitors versus other antihyperglycemic agents. The study uses real-world data from a large insurance claims database and employs statistical methods such as Cox regression models and propensity score matching to estimate and compare DKA risk. The primary goal is to produce evidence about the safety and risks associated with specific medical interventions, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation. While the study employs methodological approaches, its primary focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies but rather on applying established methods to address a clinical question.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
