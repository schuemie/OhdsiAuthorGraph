Discussion: This publication discusses the use of active learning methods to reduce the effort of labeling instances for classification by domain experts. It introduces a framework for classifying the severity of clinical conditions and compares the performance of active learning methods with standard passive learning methods. The study also examines the effect of learning from labels created by a majority consensus of a group of labelers. This publication falls under the category of methodological research as it develops and empirically evaluates analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in informatics. It does not directly deal with open community data standards, open source development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
