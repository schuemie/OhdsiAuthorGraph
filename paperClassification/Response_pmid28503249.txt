Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a novel statistical method for analyzing rare adverse drug events (ADEs) using massive observational healthcare databases. The research introduces a hierarchical model that incorporates shared pathology across multiple outcomes, improving the accuracy of risk estimates. The study also addresses computational challenges associated with scaling such models and demonstrates their feasibility and benefits through synthetic and real-world data. Given the emphasis on developing and evaluating a new analytic approach, this work aligns most closely with **methodological research**, as it contributes to scientific best practices in statistics and epidemiology.

While the study uses observational healthcare data, its primary focus is not on generating clinical evidence or conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses (category 4). Similarly, it does not involve creating open-source software tools (category 3) or maintaining community data standards (category 1). Instead, the publication is centered on advancing statistical methodology.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
