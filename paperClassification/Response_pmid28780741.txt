Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the presence of channeling bias in observational studies comparing paracetamol and ibuprofen, and explores methodological approaches to mitigate this bias using large-scale propensity score matching and negative control models. The study is primarily concerned with improving the validity of observational research methods and assessing the effectiveness of statistical techniques to address confounding and bias. This aligns closely with the goals of **Methodological research**, which involves developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics and epidemiology.

While the study generates clinical evidence about the use of paracetamol and ibuprofen, its primary focus is on the methodological aspect—how to address channeling bias in observational studies—rather than directly producing clinical evidence about the drugs' safety or efficacy. Therefore, the most appropriate category is **Methodological research**.
