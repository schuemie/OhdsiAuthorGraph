Discussion: The publication discusses the development and application of APHRODITE, an R-package phenotyping framework that uses EHR data available in the OHDSI Common Data Model. This tool is designed for standardized and scalable deployment, and it allows for the sharing of phenotype models and model construction workflows between multiple OHDSI sites. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of open source development, as it discusses the creation of a software tool that enables consistent and reproducible processes. However, the publication also touches on methodological research, as it compares the performance of APHRODITE with traditional rule-based phenotyping approaches. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the development and application of the APHRODITE tool, suggesting that open source development is the most appropriate category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
