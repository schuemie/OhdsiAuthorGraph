Discussion: This publication discusses the development of a machine learning algorithm to classify drugs of unknown fetal effect. The study uses data derived from Electronic Health Records and chemoinformatics to train a random forest model. The model is then used to classify 'category C' drugs into harmful or safe categories. This work involves the use of data, informatics, and statistical methods to generate clinical evidence. Therefore, it could potentially fall under all categories except for "Open community data standards". However, the main focus of the paper is on generating clinical evidence about the safety of 'category C' drugs during pregnancy. Therefore, the most appropriate category would be "Clinical evidence generation".

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
