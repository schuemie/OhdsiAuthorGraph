Discussion: The publication discusses the challenge of representing knowledge uniformly across different electronic health record (EHR) systems. It reviews studies on knowledge representation in common data models like OMOP and its Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program, and the US Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORNet). It also reviews the Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource standard that supports app-like programs that can be used across multiple EHR and research systems. The focus of the paper is on the development and use of common data models to support interoperable knowledge representation, which is a key aspect of data standardization. Therefore, the publication falls under the category of "Open community data standards".

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
