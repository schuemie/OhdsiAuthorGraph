Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the performance of sequential analysis methods for active drug safety surveillance using observational data. The study compares two specific methods (CSSP and LLMP) in terms of their ability to identify known drug-outcome associations, computational performance, and false positive rates. The emphasis is on determining the scientific best practices for applying sequential methods in real-world data settings, which aligns with the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches in statistics and epidemiology. This type of work falls under the category of **Methodological research**, as it seeks to refine and assess methods for analyzing observational data in the context of drug safety surveillance.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
