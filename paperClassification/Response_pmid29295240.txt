Discussion: The publication discusses a method for transforming free-text clinical research eligibility criteria into a structured relational database compliant with standards for medical terminologies and clinical data models. This involves the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the paper also discusses the development of a database schema design and the use of a hybrid natural language processing system and a concept normalization tool, which could be seen as part of open source development. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the use and application of the OMOP CDM, which makes it more appropriate to classify it under open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
