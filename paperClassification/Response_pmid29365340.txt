Discussion: The publication discusses the implementation of the OMOP common data model and OHDSI tools in a consortium of German university hospitals. The focus is on data integration and sharing, harmonizing terminologies, and facilitating research analyses across institutions. This involves the preparation of vocabularies and terminological mapping, designing the process for importing data, and testing the approach with a federated query. The publication also discusses the challenges encountered, particularly in mapping procedures, and the need for an extension to the OMOP standard terminologies. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also touches on the use of these tools for conducting research analyses, which could fall under the category of clinical evidence generation. Given that the primary focus is on the implementation and adaptation of the OMOP common data model and OHDSI tools, the most appropriate category would be open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
