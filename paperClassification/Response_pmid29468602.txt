Discussion: This publication focuses on developing and applying a methodological approach for signal detection in longitudinal observational databases using time series analysis. The study introduces an ARIMA-based disturbance detection algorithm to identify patterns in drug-event pairs, which is a methodological innovation aimed at improving pharmacovigilance practices. The emphasis is on the development and empirical evaluation of an analytic approach, which aligns closely with the goals of methodological research within the OHDSI community. While the study generates clinical evidence by identifying disturbances in drug-event pairs, the primary focus is on the methodology itself rather than the generation of clinical evidence as the main output.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
