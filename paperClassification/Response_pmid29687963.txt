Discussion: This publication discusses the use of a common data model to address challenges in transplant outcomes research, such as integrating disparate data sources and enabling multicenter analyses. The focus is on leveraging a standardized framework to improve data integration and analysis, which aligns closely with the goals of the OHDSI community. While the article touches on clinical evidence generation by enabling outcomes research, its primary emphasis is on the informatics approach and the adoption of a common data model to facilitate this research. This aligns most closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as it involves the use and promotion of a standardized data model to improve data management and analysis.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
