Discussion: This publication discusses the development of a conceptual prediction model framework and the corresponding open-source software. The framework is designed to enable model sharing and reproducibility across computational environments and observational healthcare databases. The software implementation utilizes the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, which aligns with the open community data standards category. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development of the software tool, which is used to implement the framework across different environments. This falls under the open source development category. The paper also touches on methodological research, as it discusses the steps involved in developing the prediction models. However, this is not the main focus of the paper.

Final category: 3. Open source development
