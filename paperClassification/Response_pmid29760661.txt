Discussion: The publication discusses a new methodology for transforming observational healthcare data for use in postmarketing safety studies. The methodology involves a three-step semantic transformation approach that includes transforming source datasets to RDF format, applying semantic conversion rules to align the data with the target CDM, and populating repositories that comply with the CDM specifications. This process is designed to improve upon traditional ETL approaches by being more declarative and rigorous. The methodology was tested using real healthcare data and the OMOP CDM. The results showed that the transformed data was consistent with the source data. This publication falls under the first category of open community data standards as it discusses maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. However, it also has elements of the third category of open source development as it involves creating a new methodology for data transformation. 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
