Discussion: The publication discusses the use of electronic health records (EHRs) to study the heritability of traits and diseases. It involves the mining of emergency contact data to identify familial relationships and the use of this data to compute heritability estimates for various disease phenotypes. This work does not directly involve the OMOP common data model or OHDSI standardized vocabularies, so it does not fall under the category of open community data standards. It does not involve the creation of software tools, so it does not fall under the category of open source development. However, it does involve the development and evaluation of a novel approach to studying disease heritability, which could be considered methodological research. Moreover, it involves the generation of clinical evidence about disease heritability, which falls under the category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
