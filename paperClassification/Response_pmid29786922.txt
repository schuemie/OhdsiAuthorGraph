Discussion: This publication focuses on identifying factors that predict treatment-resistant depression (TRD) using a retrospective cohort study conducted in a claims database. The study involves generating clinical evidence by analyzing real-world data to characterize disease outcomes and predictors. The primary goal is to produce evidence that can inform healthcare providers about which patients are at higher risk of developing TRD, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation. While the study uses statistical methods and claims data, its focus is not on developing new methodologies or software tools, nor does it involve work on data standards or vocabularies.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
