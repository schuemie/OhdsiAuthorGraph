Discussion: The publication discusses the comparison of rule-based data quality assessment approaches across multiple national clinical data sharing organizations. It involves the mapping of data quality checks to the categories within the data verification context of the harmonized data quality assessment terminology. This process is crucial in maintaining data standards and ensuring data quality, which aligns with the first category of OHDSI's collaboration categories - Open community data standards. Although the study involves some level of methodological research, the primary focus is on data quality checks and standards, not on developing new analytic approaches.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
