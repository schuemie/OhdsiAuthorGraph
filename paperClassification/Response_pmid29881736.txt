Discussion: This publication focuses on the practice of data quality assessment (DQA) in electronic health record (EHR) data, identifying barriers and proposing solutions to improve DQA reporting. The study emphasizes the importance of systematic DQA and reporting for the secondary use of EHR data. This aligns closely with the goals of the OHDSI community's efforts to maintain high-quality data standards and ensure trust in data for research purposes. The focus on establishing standards and guidelines for DQA suggests a connection to the **Open community data standards** category, as this category involves maintaining conventions for data quality assessment. While the study does not directly develop new methodologies or software tools, nor does it generate clinical evidence, its emphasis on improving data quality practices and alignment within the community makes it most relevant to the first category.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
