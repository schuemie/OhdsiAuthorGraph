Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by conducting a large-scale observational study to compare the risk of psychiatric hospitalization across different monotherapies for bipolar disorders. The study uses real-world data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScanÂ® database and employs survival analysis to evaluate the relative risks associated with various drugs. The findings aim to inform clinical decision-making and improve treatment strategies for bipolar disorders. Given the emphasis on evidence generation to characterize treatment utilization and outcomes, this publication aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category.
