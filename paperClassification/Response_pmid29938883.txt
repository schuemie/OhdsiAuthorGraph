Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by conducting a real-world meta-analysis across multiple observational databases to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of canagliflozin, other SGLT2 inhibitors, and non-SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study examines outcomes such as hospitalization for heart failure and below-knee lower extremity amputation, providing population-level estimates and insights into the benefits and risks of these treatments. The methodology involves a propensity score-adjusted new-user cohort design, which is a common approach in observational studies for causal inference. The primary goal of the study is to produce evidence that characterizes treatment effects and safety profiles, complementing clinical trial data and informing clinical practice. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is focused on testing clinical hypotheses and generating evidence about treatment utilization and outcomes.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
