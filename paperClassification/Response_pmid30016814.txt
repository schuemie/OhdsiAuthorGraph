Discussion: The publication discusses the MIRACUM consortium, which aims to create interoperable data integration centres (DIC) and make data within those DIC available for innovative new IT solutions in patient care and medical research. The consortium is working on establishing an efficient governance structure, defining DIC governance rules and data sharing policies, and establishing use and access committees. They are also developing a comprehensive ecosystem of reusable open source tools (MIRACOLIX), which are linkable and interoperable amongst each other, and with the existing software environment of the MIRACUM hospitals. The publication also mentions the development of efficient data protection measures, data harmonization, a MIRACUM metadata repository, and a common data model. The methodological approach for shared data usage relies on a federated querying and analysis concept. This publication could potentially fall under the categories of open community data standards and open source development. However, the main focus seems to be on the development of standards and protocols for data sharing and interoperability, which aligns more closely with the open community data standards category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
