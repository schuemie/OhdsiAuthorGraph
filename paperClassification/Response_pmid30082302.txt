Discussion: The publication discusses a new paradigm for conducting observational studies using consistent and standardized methods to improve reproducibility. It involves the use of high-throughput observational studies and empirical calibration. This approach is demonstrated by comparing all depression treatments for a set of outcomes. The publication does not focus on the OMOP common data model or OHDSI standardized vocabularies, so it does not fall under the category of open community data standards. It does not involve the creation of software tools, so it does not fall under the category of open source development. While it does involve the generation of clinical evidence, the primary focus is on the methodological approach to improve reproducibility, which makes it fall under the category of methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
