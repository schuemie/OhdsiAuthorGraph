Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a reusable application programming interface (API) for healthcare, specifically adapting the i2b2 API to support diverse patient-centric data models. The authors have developed a methodology for extending i2b2's pre-existing API to query additional data models, and have implemented this methodology to query OMOP and PCORnet models. This work involves creating software tools and methodologies, which aligns with the open source development and methodological research categories. However, the focus is more on the creation of software tools that enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes, which is characteristic of the open source development category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
