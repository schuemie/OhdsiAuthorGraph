Discussion: The publication discusses the process of converting data from various Asian databases to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model (CDM). This involves mapping domestic drug codes to standard terminology codes, which is a significant challenge due to differences in health systems, cultures, and coding systems. The work is aimed at establishing an efficient infrastructure for multinational pharmacoepidemiologic studies. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model and OHDSI standardized vocabularies, which is part of the open community data standards. However, it also involves the generation of clinical evidence through multinational studies, which is part of the clinical evidence generation category. Despite the overlap, the main focus of the paper is on the conversion of data to a common model, which is more aligned with the open community data standards category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
