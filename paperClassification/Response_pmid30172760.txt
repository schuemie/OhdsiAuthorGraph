Discussion: The publication discusses the use of lagged linear regression to detect the physiologic effects of drugs from data in the electronic health record (EHR). It explores the impact of various methodological variations on the performance of lagged linear methods. The study also generates two gold standards for expected pairwise relationships between drugs and labs, and evaluates how different combinations of methodological perturbations reproduce these gold standards. This work is primarily focused on developing and evaluating analytic approaches, which aligns with the category of methodological research. It does not primarily focus on maintaining data standards, creating software tools, or conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
