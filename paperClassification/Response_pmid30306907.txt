Discussion: The publication discusses the use of Common Data Models (CDMs) in enhancing international big data analytics, specifically in the context of a diabetes cohort study. It compares three different CDMs, including the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP), and evaluates their effectiveness based on pre-defined criteria. This involves the maintenance and application of the OMOP common data model, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the study also involves a degree of methodological research, as it empirically evaluates and compares different CDMs. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the use and evaluation of data standards, rather than the development of new methodologies.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
