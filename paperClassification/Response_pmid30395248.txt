Discussion: This publication discusses the process of mapping condition codes from source billing vocabularies to a clinical vocabulary, specifically the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). The study evaluates the effect of this mapping on patient cohorts and the potential errors that may arise. The focus is on the translation of data from source vocabularies to SNOMED CT and the efficiency and transportability of research that this enables. This falls under the work of maintaining the OMOP common data model and OHDSI standardized vocabularies, which is part of the open community data standards category. However, it also involves a degree of methodological research as it evaluates the performance of this mapping process. Despite this, the primary focus is on the standardization of vocabularies and their application in research, making the open community data standards category the most appropriate.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
