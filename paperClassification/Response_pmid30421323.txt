Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP CDM to analyze treatment pathways for three chronic diseases in China. It involves the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from the Clinical Data Repository of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University into the OMOP CDM. The study then compares the treatment pathways with recommendations from guidelines, discusses differences and standardization of medications in different medical institutions, and explores population diversification and changes of clinical treatment. This could potentially fall under the categories of open community data standards, as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM, and clinical evidence generation, as it conducts a study to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence. However, the main focus of the study seems to be on the generation of clinical evidence through the analysis of treatment pathways.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
