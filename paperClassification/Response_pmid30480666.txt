Discussion: The publication discusses the Columbia Open Health Data (COHD), a database derived from Columbia University Irving Medical Center's OHDSI database. The database contains prevalence and co-occurrence frequencies between conditions, drugs, procedures, and demographics from electronic health records (EHRs). The data is made publicly accessible and can be used for various biomedical research tasks. This publication seems to fall under the category of "Open community data standards" as it discusses the maintenance and sharing of a standardized database derived from EHRs. However, it also touches on "Open source development" as it mentions that the code for the database is available on GitHub. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the data standards and their application in biomedical research, making "Open community data standards" the most appropriate category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
