Discussion: This publication discusses a cross-national comparative study on the penetration patterns of new antidiabetic medications in East Asian countries and the United States. The study uses various databases, including the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, a random sample of the Hong Kong Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System, the Japan Medical Data Center database, and a 5% random sample of the US Medicare database. The study provides important information on patterns of market penetration of new classes of antidiabetic medications, which is crucial for subsequent research and for analyzing and interpreting results. This study does not seem to focus on data standards, methodological research, or open source development. Instead, it is more aligned with the generation of clinical evidence through network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
