Discussion: This publication is a study that uses the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network to analyze the effectiveness of second-line treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study uses electronic medical records and insurance claims data to generate evidence. The data sets were transformed into a unified common data model and analyzed using open-source analytical tools. The study is focused on generating clinical evidence, specifically on the effectiveness of different drug classes in reducing hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and the risk of myocardial infarction, kidney disorders, and eye disorders in patients with T2D treated with metformin as a first-line therapy. Therefore, the publication falls under the category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
