Discussion: This publication presents a study that uses observational data to assess the outcomes of metformin use during pregnancy, particularly among Indigenous women in Australia's Northern Territory. The study does not focus on the development of new methodologies, software tools, or data standards. Instead, it uses existing methods to generate clinical evidence about the effects of metformin use during pregnancy. Therefore, the publication falls under the category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
