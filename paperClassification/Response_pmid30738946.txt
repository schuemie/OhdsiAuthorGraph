Discussion: This publication discusses the development and evaluation of an informatics platform known as ADEpedia-on-OHDSI, which converts spontaneous reporting data from FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into the OHDSI Common Data Model (CDM) format. This work involves the creation of an extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) tool, and the evaluation of its performance and accuracy. This falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. However, it also touches on "Open source development" as it involves creating software tools that enable the community to execute analyses. Lastly, it also involves "Clinical evidence generation" as it uses the platform to validate previously published findings related to the vascular safety profile of triptans. Despite the overlap, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of the ETL tool and the conversion of FAERS data into the OHDSI CDM format, which falls under "Open community data standards".

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
