Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of i2b2 data into the OMOP common data model for the All Of Us Research Program. This involves the development of an i2b2-to-OMOP transformation, driven by the ARCH-OMOP ontology and the OMOP concept mapping dictionary. The process of ensuring the transformed data's self-integrity using OMOP's visual Achilles data quality tool is also discussed. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. Although the publication also mentions the development of an open-source tool, the main focus is on data standardization and quality assessment, not on the tool's development.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
