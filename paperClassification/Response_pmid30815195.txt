Discussion: The publication discusses the use of machine learning to identify cases of metastatic prostate cancer using electronic health records. This involves the use of a classifier trained on structured EHR data, which is then used to identify patients with metastatic disease. The study also compares the performance of this classifier with that of an ICD code-based query. This falls under the development and evaluation of analytic approaches, which is part of methodological research. It also involves the use of the OHDSI data model, which is related to open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the methodological approach of using machine learning to identify cases of a specific disease, which is more aligned with methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
