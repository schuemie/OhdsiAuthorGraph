Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a portable phenotyping system that integrates rule-based and machine learning approaches. It uses the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to extract clinically relevant features from unstructured text and incorporates OHDSI's OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to standardize necessary data elements. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of OMOP CDM for standardization. However, the publication also involves the creation of a software tool, which suggests it could also fall under the "Open source development" category. Despite this, the primary focus of the publication seems to be on the use of data standards to facilitate portability and standardization, rather than on the development of the software tool itself.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
