Discussion: The publication discusses the development of PatientExploreR, an application that allows for dynamic visualization of patient clinical history from electronic health records (EHRs) in the OMOP common data model. The software is designed to make EHR data more accessible to researchers who may lack computational expertise or domain knowledge. This falls under the category of creating software tools that enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes. However, it also touches on the aspect of open community data standards as it uses the OMOP common data model. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development and application of the software tool, making it more aligned with the open source development category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
