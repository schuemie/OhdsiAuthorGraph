Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and application of a machine learning classifier to identify missed cases of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) using electronic health record (EHR) data. The study involves creating a predictive model, validating its performance, and demonstrating its utility in identifying high-risk patients for further screening. While the work involves methodological aspects (e.g., training and evaluating a random forest classifier), the primary goal is to generate clinical evidence by identifying undiagnosed cases of FH and improving patient management strategies. This aligns with the OHDSI collaboration category of **Clinical evidence generation**, as the study aims to produce evidence for disease interception and precision medicine.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
