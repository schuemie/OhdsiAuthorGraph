Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of a linked data version of the OHDSI vocabulary, which is aimed at enhancing interoperability across multiple data sites. This work involves the integration of over 100 controlled vocabularies into the OHDSI's own, and the establishment of connections with external resources like bioportal, bio2rdf, etc. This falls under the scope of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. Therefore, it can be classified under the "Open community data standards" category. Although it also involves some aspects of open source development, the main focus is on data standards and vocabularies.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
