Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP Common Data Model to facilitate the implementation of clinical phenotypes across a network. It highlights the challenges and benefits of using a common data model, such as speeding up phenotype implementation and mitigating human error in reinterpretation of a narrative phenotype definition. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it does not seem to focus on methodological research, open source development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
