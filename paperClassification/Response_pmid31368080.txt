Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of a regulatory intervention (risk minimization) using a novel visualization tool (chronographs) applied to observational longitudinal databases. The study involves generating clinical evidence about prescriber behavior changes and outcomes (fracture and osteoporosis) following a label change for proton pump inhibitors. While the study uses a methodological tool (chronographs), its primary aim is to generate clinical evidence about the impact of the intervention. The emphasis is on assessing real-world outcomes and prescriber behavior changes, which aligns with the goals of clinical evidence generation. The methodological aspect is secondary to the study's focus on evaluating the intervention's effectiveness.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
