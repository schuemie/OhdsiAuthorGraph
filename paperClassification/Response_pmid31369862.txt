Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of a tool called PheValuator, which is used to estimate the performance of phenotype algorithms (PAs) in defining diseases in observational healthcare databases. This involves creating a diagnostic predictive model for the phenotype, applying the model to a large set of randomly selected subjects, and comparing each subject's predicted probability for the phenotype to inclusion/exclusion in PAs. This process falls under the development of analytic approaches and their empirical evaluation, which is characteristic of methodological research. However, the creation of the PheValuator tool also involves software development, which is a characteristic of open source development. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the methodology for evaluating PAs, rather than the software tool itself.
