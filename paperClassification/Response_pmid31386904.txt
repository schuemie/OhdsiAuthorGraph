Discussion: This publication discusses the development of a model, the Current Risk of Smoking Status (CROSS), to predict the smoking status of patients based on claims data. The model was trained using a subset of patients with self-reported smoking status and validated across multiple other claims data. The model can be implemented to any US insurance claims mapped to the OMOP common data model. This publication falls under the categories of methodological research and open source development. It involves methodological research as it develops and validates a new model for predicting smoking status. It also involves open source development as the model is made available for implementation in any US insurance claims mapped to the OMOP common data model. However, the main focus of the publication is on the development and validation of the model, which makes it more aligned with methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
