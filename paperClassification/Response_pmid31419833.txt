Discussion: The publication discusses the contributions to Clinical Research Informatics in 2018, focusing on the use of large-scale, harmonized data from diverse digital sources. It mentions the development and evaluation of a data quality assessment tool that can be run on different architectures, including EHRs and Clinical Data Warehouses based on PCORnet or OMOP data models. This suggests that the paper could fall under the category of "Open community data standards". However, the paper also discusses the use of algorithms for detecting co-morbidities and predicting heart failure hospital admissions, which could place it in the "Methodological research" category. The paper also touches on the development of big data and new artificial intelligence technologies, which could suggest the "Open source development" category. However, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the use and quality of data in clinical research, which is most closely aligned with the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
