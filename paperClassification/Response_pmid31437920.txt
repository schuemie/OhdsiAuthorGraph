Discussion: The publication discusses the process of transforming Electronic Patient Records (ePR) to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) format using OHDSI tools and SQL scripts. This involves the initial database characterization, relational source mappings, selection filters, data transformations, and patient de-identification. The authors also evaluate the resulting database by comparing it to a previous reference study. This work falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. It also touches on open source development as it uses open-source OHDSI tools. However, the main focus is on the transformation of data to the OMOP CDM, which is a key aspect of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
