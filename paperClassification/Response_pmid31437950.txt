Discussion: The publication discusses a methodology for assessing data quality in electronic health records, specifically focusing on the detection of systemic data quality issues. This involves the use of aggregate statistics and concept-level temporal frequencies, as well as the application of K-means clustering to detect common temporal patterns in concept frequencies. The methodology is applied to a specific database, and the results are analyzed to identify patterns that suggest data quality issues. This work falls under the scope of developing and evaluating analytic approaches, which is characteristic of methodological research. However, it also touches on the aspect of maintaining data quality, which is related to open community data standards. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development and application of a specific methodology, which makes it more aligned with methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
