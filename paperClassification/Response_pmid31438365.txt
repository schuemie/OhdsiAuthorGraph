Discussion: The publication discusses the development and testing of a new cancer module as part of the OMOP CDM, which is used for observational research in cancer. This involves the standardization of data and analytics, which aligns with the first category of open community data standards. However, it also involves the creation of a new tool, which could potentially fall under the third category of open source development. Despite this, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the standardization of data and analytics, rather than the development of the tool itself.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
