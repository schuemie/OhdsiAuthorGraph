Discussion: The publication discusses the use of natural language processing (NLP) to automatically detect a patient's eligibility for clinical trials based on unstructured clinical data. This involves the development and evaluation of an NLP application, which is used to extract eligibility criteria from electronic health records (EHRs) and determine trial eligibility. The study also involves the use of the OMOP common data model for storing clinical data. While the use of the OMOP common data model suggests a connection to open community data standards, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of the NLP application. Therefore, the publication is primarily related to methodological research and open source development. However, since the paper does not mention the release of the developed software as an open-source tool, it is more appropriate to categorize it under methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
