Discussion: The publication focuses on developing a standardized and generic data quality (DQ) framework for electronic health record (EHR) data, specifically within the MIRACUM consortium. It emphasizes the importance of data quality for secondary use in clinical research and describes the creation of a data quality analysis (DQA) tool that integrates with the i2b2 data repository. The tool is designed to assess data quality dimensions, identify inconsistencies, and improve ETL processes. This aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and improving data standards, particularly in the context of extract-transform-load (ETL) processes and data quality assessment. While the publication also touches on software development (e.g., the creation of the DQA tool), its primary focus is on establishing conventions and frameworks for data quality, which falls under the category of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
