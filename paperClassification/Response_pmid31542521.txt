Discussion: This publication discusses the development of a novel scoring system to quantify the portability of phenotype algorithms, with a focus on the use of the OMOP common data model (CDM) to assist with vocabulary mapping tasks. This suggests that the publication could fall under the category of "Open community data standards", as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM. However, the publication also involves the development and evaluation of a new method (the KIP scoring system), which suggests that it could also fall under the category of "Methodological research". The publication does not seem to involve the creation of new software tools, so it is unlikely to fall under the category of "Open source development". Similarly, it does not seem to involve the testing of clinical hypotheses or the production of clinical evidence, so it is unlikely to fall under the category of "Clinical evidence generation".

Final category: 2. Methodological research
