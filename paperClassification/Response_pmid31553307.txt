Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of maps from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes to phecodes. This involves the use of various methods and resources, including concept relationships and explicit mappings from different health and medical organizations. The work is focused on standardizing and transforming data, which aligns with the first category of open community data standards. However, it also involves some methodological research in assessing the coverage and fidelity of the maps. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the development of these mappings, which is more related to data standards than methodological research.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
