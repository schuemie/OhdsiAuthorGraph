Discussion: The publication discusses the KETOS platform, a tool for researchers to perform statistical analyses and deploy resulting models in a clinical setting. The platform uses Docker virtualization, Jupyter Notebook, and interfaces with web services using the HL7 FHIR standard to access patient data. It also uses an OMOP common data model (OMOP-CDM) database. The platform supports the entire research lifecycle from creating a data analysis environment, retrieving data, and training to final deployment in a hospital setting. This publication touches on several categories. It involves the use of the OMOP common data model, which falls under the category of open community data standards. It also involves the development of a software tool, which falls under the category of open source development. However, the main focus of the publication is on the development and deployment of the KETOS platform, which is a software tool. Therefore, the most appropriate category is open source development.

Final category: Open source development
