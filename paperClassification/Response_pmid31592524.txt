Discussion: The publication discusses the development of Leaf, a web application for querying clinical data from various data models and sources. This tool is designed to facilitate secondary use of clinical data, particularly in academic medical centers and health systems. The tool is open-source and does not require a specific data model, making it flexible and accessible for various users. The publication does not focus on the OMOP common data model or OHDSI standardized vocabularies, so it does not fit into the "Open community data standards" category. It also does not focus on methodological research in statistics, epidemiology, or informatics. While the tool could potentially be used in clinical evidence generation, the publication does not discuss specific network studies or clinical hypotheses. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this publication is "Open source development," as it discusses the creation of a software tool that enables consistent and reproducible processes in data querying and analysis.

Final category: 3. Open source development
