Discussion: The publication discusses the feasibility of using real-world data, specifically insurance claims and electronic health records (EHRs), to replicate clinical trials. It evaluates the potential of observational data to answer the same clinical questions as traditional clinical trials. This involves assessing the availability and applicability of real-world data in replicating the intervention, indication, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and primary end points of clinical trials. This falls under the scope of methodological research as it involves the development and evaluation of an analytic approach to determine scientific best practices in epidemiology and informatics. It does not directly involve the maintenance of data standards, software tool development, or conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
