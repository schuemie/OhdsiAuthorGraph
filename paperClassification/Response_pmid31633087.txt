Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of ROMOP, an R package designed to interface with EHR data in the OMOP CDM format. This tool is designed to streamline typical EHR-related data processes, including exploration of data types, extraction and summarization of patient clinical and demographic data, and patient searches using any CDM vocabulary concept. This falls under the development of software tools that enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes. Therefore, it aligns with the "Open source development" category. Although it also touches on the OMOP common data model, which is related to "Open community data standards", the main focus is on the development of the ROMOP tool, making "Open source development" the most appropriate category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
