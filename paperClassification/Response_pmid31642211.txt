Discussion: This publication focuses on generating real-world evidence to compare the effectiveness of different first-line dual combination treatments for hypertension. The study involves analyzing multinational cohorts, applying large-scale propensity score matching, and evaluating clinical outcomes such as mortality and cardiovascular events. The primary goal is to produce evidence that characterizes treatment utilization and outcomes, which aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category. While the study may involve methodological aspects (e.g., propensity score matching) and use standardized data models, its primary focus is on answering clinical questions and generating evidence for treatment effectiveness.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
