Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of the Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse health care database into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). It focuses on the development of a quality assurance (QA) process and code base to prevent incremental load errors during this transformation. This involves addressing challenges related to completeness, value conformance, and relational conformance data-quality elements. The paper also discusses the potential impacts of incremental load failure. This work is primarily related to the maintenance of the OMOP CDM and the development of community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, it also touches on the development of tools and processes, which could be seen as related to open source development. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the standards and conventions for data transformation and quality assurance, making the open community data standards category the most appropriate.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
