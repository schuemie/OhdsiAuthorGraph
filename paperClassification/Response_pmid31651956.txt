Discussion: This publication focuses on using machine learning (ML) to impute uncoded self-harm events in administrative claims data for individuals with major mental illness (MMI). The study involves developing and validating ML classifiers to recover unrecorded self-harm events and characterizing their incidence and associated factors. The work primarily revolves around methodological innovation in applying ML techniques to improve data quality and inform psychiatric epidemiological studies. While the study generates clinical insights about self-harm incidence and coding bias, its primary contribution lies in the development and evaluation of ML methods for imputation and characterization, which aligns with methodological research.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
