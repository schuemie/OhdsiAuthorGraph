Discussion: This publication focuses on conducting a large-scale, multinational observational study to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of first-line antihypertensive drug classes. The study uses real-world evidence from multiple databases to test clinical hypotheses about the relative risks and benefits of different drug classes. The framework developed for this study addresses methodological challenges such as residual confounding and publication bias, but the primary focus is on generating clinical evidence about the treatment of hypertension. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence characterizing treatment utilization and estimating the effects of medical interventions for comparative effectiveness and safety.

While the study employs advanced methodological approaches and a systematic framework, the primary goal is not to develop or evaluate new analytic methods (which would fall under **Methodological research**) or create software tools (which would fall under **Open source development**). Similarly, the study does not focus on maintaining or advancing data standards like the OMOP common data model, which would align with **Open community data standards**.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
