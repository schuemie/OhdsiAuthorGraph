Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a predictive model to infer disease severity in rheumatoid arthritis using administrative claims data. The study involves creating a patient-level prediction model, validating it across multiple databases, and providing an open-source R package for researchers to use the model. The primary focus is on predictive modeling, which aligns with methodological research aimed at improving analytic approaches in epidemiology and informatics. Additionally, the availability of an open-source R package suggests a contribution to open source development. However, the core of the study is the development and validation of a methodological approach to address confounding by disease severity, which is a methodological challenge in pharmacoepidemiology. Therefore, the most appropriate category is **Methodological research**.
