Discussion: This publication discusses the adaptation of an electronic health record-based algorithm for chronic kidney disorder (CKD) to be used on administrative claims data. The authors have used data and vocabulary standardized across the OHDSI network to improve the generalizability and consistency of the CKD phenotypes. This work involves the use of the OMOP common data model and OHDSI standardized vocabularies, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of an algorithm, which is a methodological research activity. The paper does not primarily focus on creating software tools (open source development) or conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses (clinical evidence generation).

Final category: 2. Methodological research
