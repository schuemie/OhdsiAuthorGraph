Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing real-world treatment patterns and sequences of pharmacotherapy for patients diagnosed with depression. The study uses large-scale claims databases to generate evidence about how patients are treated, including the types of medications prescribed and the sequences in which they are used. The primary goal is to characterize treatment utilization and identify gaps in care, which aligns with the generation of clinical evidence. The study does not focus on developing new methodologies, software tools, or data standards, but rather on producing evidence about disease treatment patterns and outcomes.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
