Discussion: The publication discusses the development and validation of a prognostic model to predict the risk of Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke. The model was developed using a Lasso Logistic Regression prediction model with a large, US Electronic Health Record dataset structured to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). The model was then validated across 10 additional real-world healthcare datasets. This work involves the use of the OMOP CDM, which falls under the category of Open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and validation of a predictive model, which is a methodological research activity. Therefore, the paper could potentially fall under either of these categories. However, given that the primary contribution of the paper is the development and validation of the predictive model, it is more appropriate to classify it under Methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
