Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of French national electronic health records into the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). It involves the process of auditing the source data, specifying the transformation into the OMOP CDM, implementing an extract-transform-load process, and evaluating the final database. This process involves the standardization of data, facilitating data exchange, sharing, and storage. The publication also discusses the challenges faced during the transformation process, particularly the use of international OMOP concepts to annotate data recorded in a French context. Given these points, the publication falls under the category of Open community data standards, as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
