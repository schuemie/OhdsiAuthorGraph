Discussion: This publication presents a retrospective cohort analysis of patients who received intrauterine devices (IUDs) at Columbia University Medical Center. The study aims to evaluate the relative risk of cervical neoplasms among copper intrauterine device (Cu IUD) and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) users. The data used in the study were transformed to a common data model and are part of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network. The study involves the use of procedure codes, condition codes, and medication exposures in billing and claims data to identify the cohort patients and outcomes. The study also involves the use of propensity score stratification and propensity score 1:1 matching to adjust for confounding. The publication does not focus on maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. It also does not focus on developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics, epidemiology, and informatics. The publication does not focus on creating software tools that codify best practices and enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes. The publication primarily focuses on conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, estimating effects of medical interventions for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness, and predicting outcomes for disease interception and precision medicine.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
