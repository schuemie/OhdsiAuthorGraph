Discussion: The publication presents a retrospective multicentre analysis of clinical outcomes and treatment-related toxicity in patients with Oligometastatic/Oligoprogressive (OM/OP) NSCLC treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and/or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT). The study involves the analysis of patient data, treatment methods, and outcomes, which is related to the generation of clinical evidence. The publication does not seem to focus on data standards, methodological research, or open-source development. Therefore, it does not fit into the categories of open community data standards, methodological research, or open source development. Instead, it aligns with the category of clinical evidence generation as it involves conducting a study to produce evidence about the treatment of OM/OP NSCLC.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
