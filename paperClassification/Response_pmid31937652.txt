Discussion: This publication discusses the application of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) to analyze pediatric drug usage in several countries. The study is observational and descriptive, focusing on the prevalence of drug usage in different age groups and settings. The research does not seem to involve the development of new methodologies or software tools, nor does it test clinical hypotheses or generate clinical evidence about specific diseases or treatments. Instead, it uses the OMOP CDM to standardize and analyze data from different sources, which aligns with the category of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
