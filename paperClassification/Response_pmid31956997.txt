Discussion: The publication discusses the implementation and validation of the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) on IQVIA Medical Research Data (IMRD)-UK data. It also provides recommendations for good practice in transforming to CDMs. This suggests that the publication is primarily concerned with data standards and their application, which aligns with the first category of "Open community data standards". However, the publication also involves a case study on the prescribing of codeine for pain in children, which could potentially fall under the fourth category of "Clinical evidence generation". Despite this, the main focus of the publication appears to be on the data standards and their implementation, rather than the clinical implications of the case study.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
