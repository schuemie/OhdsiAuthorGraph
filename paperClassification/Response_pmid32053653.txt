Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and validation of a patient-level prediction model for opioid use disorder using population-level claims data. The study involves creating a predictive model (CROUD score) based on demographic and clinical variables, which can be used to stratify patients into risk groups. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence that can inform personalized opioid dispensing guidelines and improve patient education. While the study employs methodological approaches to build and validate the model, its primary focus is on generating clinical evidence to predict outcomes and guide clinical decision-making. Therefore, the most appropriate category is **Clinical evidence generation**, as the study aims to produce evidence for disease interception and precision medicine.

Final category: 4
