Discussion: The publication discusses the ALCAPONE project, which aims to assess case-based designs for drug safety alert generation in the French National Healthcare System Database (SNDS). The project involves data preparation to fit the OMOP Common Data Model, detection of selected controls via three case-based designs, comparison of design variant performance, and selection of the optimal design variants for each outcome. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of the OMOP Common Data Model. However, the publication also involves methodological research, as it involves the empirical assessment of pharmacoepidemiological approaches for drug safety alert generation. Therefore, it could also fall under the category of "Methodological research". 

Final category: 2. Methodological research
