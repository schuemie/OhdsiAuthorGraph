Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of French Electronic Health Records into the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's Common Data Model. This process involves the use of data standards and conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) processes, which falls under the category of open community data standards. It does not seem to involve methodological research, open source development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
