Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to antiseizure drugs (ASDs) using the common data model (CDM). The study involves generating clinical evidence by leveraging electronic health record data to characterize the incidence and trends of ADRs associated with specific ASDs. The research aligns with the goal of producing evidence to inform clinical practice, particularly in pharmacovigilance and drug safety. While the study uses the CDM, its primary focus is not on developing or maintaining the data standards themselves, nor does it emphasize methodological research or open-source software development. Instead, the publication is centered on clinical evidence generation through the application of the CDM to answer specific clinical questions about ADRs.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
