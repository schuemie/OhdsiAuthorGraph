Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing trends in the initiation of therapy for secondary fracture prevention across multiple countries using routinely collected patient data. The study evaluates treatment gaps and provides evidence on the utilization of anti-osteoporotic medications following fragility fractures. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about treatment patterns and gaps in care, which aligns with the OHDSI collaboration category of **Clinical evidence generation**. The study does not focus on developing data standards, methodological research, or open-source tools, but rather on producing evidence to inform clinical practice and policy.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
