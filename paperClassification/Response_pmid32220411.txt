Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing clinical outcomes and service utilization patterns among primary care patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) and co-occurring chronic conditions. The study uses electronic health record data to conduct a longitudinal cohort observational analysis, comparing clinical outcomes and service utilization between patients with and without SUD diagnoses. The research generates evidence about disease natural history, treatment utilization, and care pathways for patients with comorbid conditions. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence characterizing disease patterns and treatment utilization, which can inform clinical practice and policy.

While the study does involve observational data and statistical analysis, it does not primarily focus on developing or evaluating new methodological approaches, which would align with the **Methodological research** category. Similarly, the study does not involve the creation or maintenance of data standards or open-source tools, ruling out the **Open community data standards** and **Open source development** categories.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
