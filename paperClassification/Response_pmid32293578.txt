Discussion: This publication discusses a study that used the Korean common data model (K-CDM) network database to analyze the effect of age at diagnosis on the prognosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Korea. The study used the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) network and its open-source data analytics. The study also transformed the electronic medical record into the CDM version 5.0 used in OHDSI. The study then conducted a retrospective analysis of the K-CDM network database from 2005 to 2015. The study is not about maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. It is also not about developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics, epidemiology, and informatics. The study is also not about creating software tools that codify best practices and enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes. The study is about conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, estimating effects of medical interventions for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness, and predicting outcomes for disease interception and precision medicine.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
