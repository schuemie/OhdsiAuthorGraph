Discussion: The publication discusses the use of electronic health records for health outcomes and population sciences research, specifically focusing on the portability of phenotype algorithms across different research networks. It proposes a framework for improving the portability of these algorithms, which involves using a common data model, standardized representation of the phenotype algorithm logic, and technical solutions for federated execution of queries. This work seems to touch on several collaboration categories. It involves the use of a common data model and standardized vocabularies, which falls under the "Open community data standards" category. It also involves the development of a new framework, which could be seen as a form of methodological research. However, the main focus of the paper is on improving the portability of phenotype algorithms, which is a technical solution that falls under the "Open source development" category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
