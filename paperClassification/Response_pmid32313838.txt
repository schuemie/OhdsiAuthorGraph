Discussion: The publication describes the European Medical Information Framework (EMIF), which focuses on creating a unified platform for sharing healthcare data across Europe. Key aspects of the project include data harmonization using a common data model, ethical governance for data protection, and tools for data discovery and characterization. These elements align closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as the project emphasizes the development and maintenance of a common data model and standardized approaches for data sharing and harmonization. Additionally, the publication mentions the facilitation of real-world data research and the generation of clinical evidence, which could suggest relevance to the **Clinical evidence generation** category. However, the primary focus of the publication is on the infrastructure and standards for data sharing and harmonization, rather than conducting specific network studies or generating clinical evidence.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
