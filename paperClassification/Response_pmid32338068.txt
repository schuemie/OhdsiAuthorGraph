Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by conducting an observational study to evaluate the risk of acute pancreatitis among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with canagliflozin compared to other antihyperglycemic agents. The study uses claims databases and applies statistical methods such as propensity score adjustment and Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios. The primary goal is to produce evidence about the safety of canagliflozin in comparison to other treatments, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation. While the study employs methodological approaches, its primary focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies but rather on applying established methods to answer a clinical question. It does not involve open community data standards or open-source software development.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
