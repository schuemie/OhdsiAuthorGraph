Discussion: This publication discusses the development and validation of phenotype classifiers using the Automated PHenotype Routine for Observational Definition, Identification, Training and Evaluation (APHRODITE) R-package. This involves the use of machine learning methods and the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. The study also evaluates the performance of these classifiers across multiple sites within the OHDSI network. This work involves elements of methodological research, as it involves the development and evaluation of analytic approaches. It also involves elements of open source development, as it involves the creation of a tool (the APHRODITE R-package) that enables the community to execute analyses. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and validation of a method (phenotype classifiers), which aligns more closely with the category of methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
