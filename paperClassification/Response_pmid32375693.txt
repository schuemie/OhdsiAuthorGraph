Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OHDSI collaborative network and standardization to scale-up external validation of patient-level prediction models across multiple observational healthcare datasets. This involves the replication of five previously published prognostic models and their validation across nine datasets from three countries and five independent sites. The study demonstrates the ability to scale up and speed up external validation of prediction models using a collaborative approach and data standardization. This falls under the category of methodological research as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches. However, it also touches on open community data standards as it utilizes the OHDSI standardization and network. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the methodological approach to scaling up external validation of prediction models, making this the most appropriate category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
