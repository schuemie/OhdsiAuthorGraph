Discussion: This publication discusses the use of real-world evidence, including spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions and observational health data, to assess a post-authorization safety signal of ischemic colitis associated with the drug nintedanib. The study involves the use of statistical screening and evidence synthesis to support causality assessment, which suggests that it involves methodological research. However, the study also involves the generation of clinical evidence through the assessment of a safety signal, which suggests that it could also fall under the category of clinical evidence generation. Despite the overlap, the primary focus of the study seems to be on the methodological approach to signal assessment, which suggests that it is primarily a methodological research study.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
