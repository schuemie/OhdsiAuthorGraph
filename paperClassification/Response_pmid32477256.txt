Discussion: The publication discusses a pilot study that uses the common data model (CDM) based on electronic health record (EHR) data to analyze treatment pathways of pediatric epilepsy. The study also aims to determine the feasibility and applicability of CDM analysis in epilepsy research. The study involves the use of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)-CDM, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the study is on generating clinical evidence about treatment pathways and drug resistance in pediatric epilepsy, which falls under the category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
