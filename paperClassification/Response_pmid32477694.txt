Discussion: This publication discusses the integration of electronic health record data into the ADEpedia-on-OHDSI platform for improved signal detection. It involves the use of the OMOP common data model (CDM) for integrating heterogeneous drug safety data sources and systems. This falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM. However, it also involves the development and application of a signal detection algorithm, which could be seen as a form of methodological research. Furthermore, the study is aimed at improving the detection of immune-related adverse events, which is a form of clinical evidence generation. Despite these overlaps, the primary focus of the paper seems to be on the integration of data using the OMOP CDM, which makes "Open community data standards" the most appropriate category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
