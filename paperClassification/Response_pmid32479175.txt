Discussion: This publication focuses on methodological considerations for conducting observational studies using electronic health record (EHR) data. It emphasizes the importance of assessing data quality, managing challenges specific to EHR data (e.g., irregular sampling, missingness, and variation), and applying principled research and reporting guidelines. These topics align closely with the goals of methodological research, as the article seeks to establish best practices for analyzing and reporting observational studies using EHR data. While the publication indirectly supports clinical evidence generation by improving the quality of studies, its primary focus is on developing and refining methodological approaches rather than generating clinical evidence or creating software tools.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
