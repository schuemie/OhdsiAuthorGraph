Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a predictive decision support architecture based on the OMOP common data model. It involves the extraction and transformation of relevant clinical and molecular data from their original sources and mapping them to OMOP. The architecture is designed to be independent of the electronic health record (EHR) and transferable to different hospital environments. This work falls under the category of open community data standards as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL). However, it also touches on open source development as it involves creating a software tool that enables the community to execute analyses. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the use of the OMOP common data model and ETL processes, making it more aligned with the open community data standards category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
