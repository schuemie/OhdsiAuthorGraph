Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the impact of channeling bias in observational studies comparing the risks of severe outcomes between paracetamol and ibuprofen. It explores methodological approaches, specifically large-scale propensity score (LSPS) matching, to mitigate bias and assess confounding. The study uses positive and negative controls to evaluate residual confounding and calibrate confidence intervals, which are methodological techniques aimed at improving the reliability of observational study results. While the study generates clinical evidence about the comparative safety of paracetamol and ibuprofen, its primary focus is on assessing and refining methodological approaches to address bias and confounding in observational research. This aligns most closely with the **Methodological research** category, as the emphasis is on evaluating analytic approaches and scientific best practices.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
