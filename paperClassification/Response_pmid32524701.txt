Discussion: This publication is focused on the empirical assessment of case-based methods for identifying drugs associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the French National Healthcare System database. The study involves the use of statistical methods and epidemiological designs (self-controlled case series, case-control, and case-population design variants) to evaluate drug safety. The authors also discuss the potential biases and errors in their approach. This work does not directly involve the development or maintenance of data standards, software tools, or the execution of clinical studies to test specific hypotheses about diseases or treatments. Therefore, it does not fall under the categories of open community data standards, open source development, or clinical evidence generation. Instead, it is most closely aligned with the category of methodological research, as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches for drug safety surveillance.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
