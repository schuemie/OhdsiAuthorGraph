Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a framework for detecting and filtering signals of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This framework uses the OHDSI common data model (CDM) to collect data and conduct signal detection, and a text-mining pipeline to filter out known irAEs from drug labels and literature. The study is focused on using real-world data to investigate the safety profiles of these drugs, and the framework developed could facilitate adverse drug event detection and filtration for improved signal detection. This falls under the category of methodological research as it involves the development and evaluation of an analytic approach. However, it also touches on open community data standards as it utilizes the OHDSI CDM. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is the development and evaluation of the framework, making methodological research the most appropriate category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
