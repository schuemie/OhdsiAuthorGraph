Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of a multicenter collaborative prediction model construction framework. This framework is designed to build a prediction model with greater generalizability and continuous improvement capabilities while preserving patient data security and privacy. The study also involves the use of a passive-aggressive online learning algorithm for continuous improvement of the prediction model. This falls under the development of new methodologies and the use of informatics to improve clinical decision making. Therefore, it aligns with the category of methodological research. However, it also involves the use of software tools and the execution of analyses, which could place it under the category of open source development. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of the method, rather than the software tool itself.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
