Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a novel methodological approach for causal inference in observational health data using a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model. The Counterfactual χ-GAN (cGAN) is introduced as a tool to enforce strong ignorability and improve causal estimation by learning a distribution that balances features and minimizes variance in effect estimates. The emphasis on methodological innovation, including the use of Pearson χ2-divergence and comparisons with established weighting methods, aligns closely with the goals of methodological research within the OHDSI community. The work does not primarily focus on creating software tools (open source development), establishing data standards, or generating clinical evidence through network studies, but rather on advancing analytic approaches and evaluating their effectiveness.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
