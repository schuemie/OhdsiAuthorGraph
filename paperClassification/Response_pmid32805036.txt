Discussion:  
The publication describes the creation and deployment of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which focuses on harmonizing clinical data from multiple organizations to enable collaborative analytics for COVID-19 research. The article emphasizes the infrastructure and processes developed to extract, aggregate, harmonize, and analyze patient-level data, as well as the creation of a secure data enclave for reproducible analytics. This aligns with the **Open community data standards** category, as it involves harmonizing data across organizations and data models, ensuring data quality, and creating a standardized dataset for research purposes. Additionally, the infrastructure and tools described could also be relevant to **Open source development**, as they enable collaborative analytics and reproducible processes. However, the primary focus of the publication is on the data standardization and harmonization efforts, which are foundational to enabling further research and analytics.

While the publication mentions the use of machine learning and statistical tools for clinical evidence generation, the emphasis is on the infrastructure and processes that make such analyses possible, rather than conducting specific network studies or generating clinical evidence directly. Therefore, the **Clinical evidence generation** category is less applicable here.

Final category: **Open community data standards**
