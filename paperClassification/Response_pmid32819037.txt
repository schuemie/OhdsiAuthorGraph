Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a toolkit, the Time-based Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (TECI), which pre-calculates time-based Elixhauser comorbidities and can be extended to common data models (CDMs). This toolkit was built using SQL and was successfully installed to compute indices from clinical data repository data. The toolkit was also extended to the Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (I2B2) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of open source development as it discusses the creation of a software tool that enables the community to execute analyses. However, the publication also touches on the potential for this tool to improve clinical outcomes, which could suggest it falls under the category of clinical evidence generation. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the development of the toolkit, making open source development the most appropriate category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
