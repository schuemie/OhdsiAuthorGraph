Discussion: The publication discusses the use of a homomorphic encryption technique to enable federated analysis of real-world data while complying with data protection requirements, the evidence value of federated data networks, and the migration of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database to the OMOP common data model. This suggests that the publication could fall under the categories of "Open community data standards" and "Methodological research". However, the main focus of the publication seems to be on the use and development of data standards and models, which is more closely related to the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
