Discussion: The publication focuses on the application of the LEGEND framework to generate and evaluate clinical evidence regarding hypertension treatments. It describes the use of large-scale observational research methods, including propensity score modeling, empirical calibration, and comparison to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to assess the validity of the evidence generated. The study emphasizes the generation of clinical evidence, including treatment comparisons and effect size estimates, and evaluates the quality and reliability of this evidence for informing medical decision-making. While methodological aspects are discussed, the primary focus is on conducting network studies to produce clinical evidence.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
