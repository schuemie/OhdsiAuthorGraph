Discussion: The publication discusses the formation of an international consortium to leverage electronic health record data to answer critical questions about COVID-19. The consortium uses the OMOP platforms to map to a common data model and focuses on temporal changes in key laboratory test values. This involves the use of standardized vocabularies and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, which aligns with the "Open community data standards" category. However, the study also involves conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses about COVID-19, which falls under the "Clinical evidence generation" category. Despite the overlap, the primary focus of the publication seems to be on the use of a common data model to harmonize data for analysis, which is more closely related to the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
