Discussion: The publication is a multinational, retrospective study that investigates the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

This falls under the scope of generating clinical evidence through network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence. The study does not focus on data standards, methodological research, or open-source development.
