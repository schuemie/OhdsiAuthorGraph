Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a tool, COVID-19 SignSym, which extracts COVID-19 signs and symptoms from clinical text and maps the information to the OMOP common data model. This tool is designed to accelerate COVID-19 clinical research. The development of this tool involves the use of deep learning-based models, curated lexicons, and pattern-based rules. The tool is freely accessible to the research community and has been used by several healthcare organizations. This publication could potentially fall under the categories of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of the OMOP common data model, and "Open source development" as it discusses the creation of a new tool. However, the main focus of the publication is on the development and application of the tool, making "Open source development" the most appropriate category.

Final category: Open source development
