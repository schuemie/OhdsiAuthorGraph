Discussion: The publication discusses the LEGEND research initiative, which aims to generate evidence on the effects of medical interventions using observational health-care databases. The initiative addresses concerns such as observational study bias, P hacking, and publication bias by following a new paradigm defined by 10 principles. These principles involve generating and disseminating evidence on many research questions at once, using a prespecified and systematic approach, employing best-practice statistical methods, and generating evidence in a network of databases to assess consistency. The initiative also emphasizes sharing open-source analytics code to enhance transparency and reproducibility, without sharing patient-level information. This publication could potentially fall under the categories of methodological research, open source development, and clinical evidence generation. However, it most strongly aligns with methodological research, as it focuses on developing and evaluating a new approach for generating and evaluating evidence from large-scale health-care data.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
