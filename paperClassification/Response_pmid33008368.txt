Discussion: The publication discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning models to predict myocardial infarction using harmonized electronic health record data. The study involves the application of various models, including logistic regression, random forest, boosted gradient machines, and neural networks, to predict the incidence of myocardial infarction. The data used in the study is harmonized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. This suggests that the publication could fall under the category of "Methodological research" as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches. However, it also involves the use of the OMOP common data model, which could suggest a relation to "Open community data standards". Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the comparison and evaluation of different predictive models, which is more aligned with "Methodological research".

Final category: 2. Methodological research
