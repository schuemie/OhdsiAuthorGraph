Discussion: The publication describes the creation and utilization of a large electronic health record (EHR) cohort to study the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including risk factors and prevention interventions. The focus is on generating clinical evidence by analyzing longitudinal data to explore disease progression, risk factors, and outcomes. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence characterizing disease natural history, treatment utilization, and prevention strategies. While the study leverages data standards and methodologies, its primary goal is to generate actionable clinical insights, making it most appropriate for the fourth category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
