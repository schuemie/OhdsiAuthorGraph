Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing a large population-based cohort to assess the risks and outcomes associated with Dupuytren's disease surgery. The study uses real-world data from England's Hospital Episode Statistics database to evaluate complications, re-operation rates, and systemic risks associated with different surgical approaches. The findings aim to inform clinical decision-making and improve patient care. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on producing evidence about disease treatment outcomes and safety.
