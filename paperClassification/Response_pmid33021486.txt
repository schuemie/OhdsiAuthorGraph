Discussion: The publication discusses the implementation of a cohort retrieval system, CREATE, that uses both structured data and unstructured text to improve cohort retrieval performance. It leverages the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model for model portability. The system uses natural language processing to extract common data model concepts from textual queries and information retrieval techniques to support the search. This falls under the development of software tools that enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes. However, it also touches on the use of the OMOP common data model, which is part of the open community data standards. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of the CREATE system, making it more aligned with the open source development category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
