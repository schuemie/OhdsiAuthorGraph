Discussion: The publication discusses the evaluation of the OMOP common data model's vocabulary in representing concepts from the UNOS transplant registry forms. The study involves the manual mapping of unique concepts and the evaluation of these mappings. The findings suggest that a significant percentage of UNOS concepts could not be represented with OMOP standard concepts, indicating gaps in the OMOP vocabulary for transplant-specific concepts. This work is primarily focused on assessing and improving the OMOP common data model, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, it also touches on the potential for clinical evidence generation by suggesting that adding these missing concepts to OMOP would facilitate further research in the transplant domain.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
