Discussion: The publication discusses a strategy for de-identifying personal health data in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) for use in a public cloud-computing environment. This involves the development of rules and privacy models to protect patient privacy. The work is related to maintaining the OMOP common data model and ensuring data quality, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, it also involves the development and evaluation of a new method for de-identification, which could be seen as methodological research. Despite this, the primary focus seems to be on the application and maintenance of the OMOP-CDM, rather than the development of new methodologies.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
