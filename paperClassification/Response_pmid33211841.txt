Discussion: This publication discusses the development and validation of a machine-learning model to predict the cause of death from a patient's last medical checkup. The model was developed using a stacking ensemble method and was validated using data from national claims and electronic health records. The data used was formatted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. This suggests that the publication could fall under the categories of "Methodological research" and "Open community data standards". However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and validation of a machine-learning model, which is a methodological research activity. The use of the OMOP Common Data Model is important but secondary to the main focus of the paper.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
