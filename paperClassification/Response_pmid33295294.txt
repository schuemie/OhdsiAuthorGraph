Discussion: This publication discusses the transformation of pathology reports into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) with the help of natural language processing (NLP). The study aims to standardize and utilize pathology data for colon cancer research. The process involves extracting text entities from pathology reports, mapping them to standard concepts in the OHDSI vocabularies, and defining relations for the CDM tables. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also involves the development of a method for converting free text-based pathology reports into the CDM's format, which could be considered methodological research. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the standardization and utilization of data, which is more aligned with the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
