Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP common data model to standardize the structure, format, and terminologies of disparate datasets. This falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the paper also discusses the use of this model for evidence generation and decision making in health technology assessment, which could be seen as clinical evidence generation. The paper also mentions the use of open-source and standardized analytics, which could be seen as open source development. However, the main focus of the paper is on the use of the common data model to facilitate access to relevant data and enable multidatabase studies, which is most closely related to open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
