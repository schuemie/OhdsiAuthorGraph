Discussion: This publication presents an international, open science, cohort analysis to determine whether the use of ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with hypertension. The study uses electronic health records from Spain and the USA to identify patients and assess outcomes. The study is observational and involves the analysis of large-scale propensity score methods derived through a data-driven approach. The study does not focus on data standards, software development, or methodological research. Instead, it conducts a network study to test a clinical hypothesis and produce evidence related to the effects of medical interventions. Therefore, the publication falls under the category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
