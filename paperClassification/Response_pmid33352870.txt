Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) following beta-blocker therapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases. The study uses data from a nationwide claims database and validates the model across multiple datasets. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about the risk factors and predictors of MDD in this patient population, which aligns with the broader aim of personalized medicine. While the study employs methodological approaches (machine learning) and utilizes standardized data, its primary focus is on generating clinical evidence to inform treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.

The most appropriate category for this publication is **Clinical evidence generation**, as the study aims to produce evidence characterizing the risk of MDD following beta-blocker therapy and applies predictive modeling to support disease interception and precision medicine.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
