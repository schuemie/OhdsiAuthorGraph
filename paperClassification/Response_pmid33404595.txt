Discussion: This publication discusses the comparison of family health history data collected from patient surveys and electronic health records (EHRs) in the All of Us Research Program. The EHR data was mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership data model, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the study is to evaluate the availability and characterization of family health history information from both sources, which is more related to clinical evidence generation. The study also mentions the potential for precision medicine, which is a part of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
