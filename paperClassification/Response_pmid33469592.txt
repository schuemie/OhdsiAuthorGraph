Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a centralized, harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record repository. It also discusses the use of this data for predictive and diagnostic tool development, critical care, and policy-making. The study uses machine learning to predict clinical severity and risk factors over time. This publication touches on several categories. It involves the use of a standardized data model (Open community data standards), the development and evaluation of analytic approaches (Methodological research), the creation of software tools for analysis (Open source development), and the generation of clinical evidence through network studies (Clinical evidence generation). However, the primary focus of the paper is on the use of the N3C data for predictive analytics and the development of machine learning models for clinical decision support, which falls under the category of Methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
