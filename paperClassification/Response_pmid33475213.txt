Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing real-world data to characterize the baseline characteristics of patients treated with esketamine compared to other groups with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The study uses retrospective analysis of large healthcare databases to describe disease burden and comorbidities, which are critical for understanding treatment utilization and informing future comparative effectiveness or safety studies. The emphasis on understanding patient characteristics and treatment patterns aligns closely with the goals of clinical evidence generation within the OHDSI community.

While the study involves methodological aspects, such as calculating standardized mean differences, its primary focus is on producing evidence about disease burden and treatment patterns, rather than developing or evaluating new analytic methods. Additionally, the study does not involve open community data standards or open-source software development.

Final category: **4. Clinical evidence generation**
