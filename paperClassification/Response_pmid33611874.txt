Discussion: This publication discusses the process of incorporating the Korean Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) vocabulary into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) vocabulary. The process involves improving the classification of EDI domains, assigning unique identifiers and validity dates to each EDI concept, building a vertical hierarchy between EDI concepts, and adding an English definition for each EDI concept. The goal of this study is to improve the Korean EDI as a standard medical ontology in Korea. This work falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
