Discussion: This publication discusses the external validation of the COVID-19 vulnerability index across a range of healthcare settings. The study aims to determine how well the index predicts hospitalization due to pneumonia in COVID-19 cases. The authors followed the OHDSI framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the index. The study involves the use of data from multiple databases across different regions, including the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The results of the study suggest that the index should not be used to aid decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. This publication falls under the category of methodological research as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics, epidemiology, and informatics. It also touches on clinical evidence generation as it conducts a study to test a clinical hypothesis. However, the primary focus is on the methodological aspect, specifically the validation of a predictive model.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
