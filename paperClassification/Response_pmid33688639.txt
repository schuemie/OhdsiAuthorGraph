Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the CHARYBDIS framework for standardization and analysis of COVID-19 real world data. The study involves a large-scale characterization of COVID-19 cases using this framework. The data and findings are made available through an interactive website. This suggests that the publication is involved in generating clinical evidence through network studies, which aligns with category 4. However, the use of the CHARYBDIS framework and the emphasis on standardization of data analysis also suggests elements of category 3, open source development. Despite this, the primary focus of the publication seems to be on the generation of clinical evidence rather than the development of the tool itself.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
