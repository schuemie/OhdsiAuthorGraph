Discussion: The publication discusses the Advanced Cohort Engine (ACE), a tool that uses a temporal query language and in-memory datastore of patient objects to provide a fast, scalable, and expressive time-aware search. It accepts data in the Observational Medicine Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, indicating a connection to open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the creation of this software tool, its capabilities, and its potential uses, which aligns more with the category of open source development. The tool is designed to enable electronic phenotyping and cohort-building with subsecond response times, which could be used for a variety of purposes, including methodological research and clinical evidence generation. However, these potential applications are not the main focus of the paper.

Final category: 3. Open source development
