Discussion: The publication discusses the development of an algorithm to extract regimen-level abstracted chemotherapy episodes from medication records in a conventional Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) database. This falls under the category of open community data standards as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM. However, the study also involves the development of application software for visualizing the chemotherapy treatment patterns based on the treatment episodes in the OMOP-CDM database, which falls under the category of open source development. Furthermore, the study conducts a retrospective analysis of anticancer treatment trajectories and patterns of clinical events according to regimen type, which falls under the category of clinical evidence generation. Although the publication touches on multiple categories, the main focus is on the development and validation of an algorithm for extracting and visualizing chemotherapy treatment patterns from the OMOP-CDM database, which is a methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
