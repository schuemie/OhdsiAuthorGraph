Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model for automated transformation to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data models (CDMs). It also discusses the production of linked clinical data repositories for COVID-19 research using the FHIR subscription standard. This involves maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) operations, which aligns with the first category of "Open community data standards". However, the publication also involves the creation of software tools for automated transformation and production of data repositories, which falls under the third category of "Open source development". 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
