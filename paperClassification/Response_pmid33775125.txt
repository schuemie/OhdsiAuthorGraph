Discussion: The title of the publication suggests that the study focuses on evaluating the comparative effectiveness and safety of Î²-blocker monotherapy in hypertensive patients. This indicates that the research involves generating clinical evidence by analyzing treatment utilization and outcomes. The mention of "large-scale multicenter observational study" further supports the idea that the study is part of clinical evidence generation, as it likely leverages real-world data from multiple sites to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence relevant to patient care. While the study may utilize standardized methods or open-source tools developed by OHDSI, its primary focus appears to be on generating clinical evidence rather than methodological research, open-source development, or data standards.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
