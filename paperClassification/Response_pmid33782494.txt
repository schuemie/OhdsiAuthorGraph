Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of electronic health record polysomnographic data into the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's Common Data Model. This involves the design and implementation of an extract-transform-load (ETL) process, which falls under the category of open community data standards. The study also validates the conversion and usefulness of the data through patient-level prediction analyses, which could be seen as methodological research. However, the main focus of the paper is on the standardization of data and the ETL process, which is more aligned with the open community data standards category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
