Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of the Clinical Trial Knowledge Base, a tool that uses natural language processing to transform free text clinical trial eligibility criteria into discrete criteria concepts and attributes. These are encoded using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and stored in a relational SQL database. This tool is used for clinical trial cohort definition, clinical trial population representativeness assessment, electronic phenotyping, and data gap analyses for using electronic health records to support clinical trial recruitment. This work could potentially fall under the categories of open community data standards, as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM, and open source development, as it involves the creation of a new tool. However, the main focus of the work is on the development and application of a method for transforming and analyzing clinical trial eligibility criteria, which aligns most closely with the category of methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
