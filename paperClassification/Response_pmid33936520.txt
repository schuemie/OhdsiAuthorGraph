Discussion: The publication discusses the normalization of clinical documents using the LOINC Document Ontology (DO), a universal clinical document standard. The study involves the development of an annotation framework and the use of a pre-trained deep learning model to enable automatic mapping from clinical note titles to LOINC DO axes. This work is related to the standardization of health data, which is a key aspect of open community data standards. However, it also involves the use of a deep learning model, which is a methodological research approach. While both categories could potentially apply, the main focus of the paper is on the application of a standard (LOINC DO) to clinical documents, which is more closely related to the open community data standards category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
