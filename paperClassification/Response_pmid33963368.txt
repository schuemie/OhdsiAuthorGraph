Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a predictive model for 90-day mortality after colorectal cancer surgery using pre- and intraoperative data from a nationwide database. The study involves creating and validating a statistical model, which aligns with the goal of predicting outcomes for disease interception and precision medicine. The emphasis on clinical application, such as identifying high- and low-risk patients to optimize treatment and healthcare resources, suggests that the primary focus is on generating clinical evidence. While the study employs methodological approaches (e.g., logistic regression and validation techniques), the ultimate aim is to produce actionable clinical insights rather than advancing methodological research itself. Therefore, the most appropriate category is **Clinical evidence generation**.
