Discussion: The publication discusses a multinational network cohort study that investigates the use of repurposed and adjuvant drugs in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 across three continents. The study uses hospital electronic health records and nationwide claims data to analyze the prescriptions or dispensations of any drug on or 30 days after the date of hospital admission for covid-19. The study identifies multiple drugs used in the first few months of the covid-19 pandemic, with substantial geographical and temporal variation. The publication suggests that research is needed on the comparative risk and benefit of these treatments in the management of covid-19. This publication does not seem to focus on data standards, methodological research, or open-source development. Instead, it appears to be generating clinical evidence through a network study to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization.
