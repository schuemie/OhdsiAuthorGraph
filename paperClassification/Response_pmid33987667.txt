Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a deep learning-based system to automate the process of semantic interinstitutional code mapping in the OMOP common data model. This falls under the scope of creating tools and systems to improve the standardization and quality of data, which is a key aspect of the "Open community data standards" category. However, the development and evaluation of this deep learning-based system also involves methodological research, which is a characteristic of the "Methodological research" category. The system is also a software tool, which could place it in the "Open source development" category. However, the focus of the paper is not on the software development process, but rather on the methodological approach and its application in improving data standardization.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
