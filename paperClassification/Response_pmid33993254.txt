Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) data model as a canonical data model and the automated transformation of clinical data to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORnet) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDMs for data sharing and research collaboration on COVID-19. This involves the process of extract, transform, and load operations for production and incremental updates of data feeds to the networks from raw EHR data. This falls under the process of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. Therefore, it can be categorized under "Open community data standards". However, it also involves the creation of software tools to automate the transformation process, which could be seen as "Open source development". Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the data standards and their application in a specific context (COVID-19 research), rather than the development of the software tools themselves.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
