Discussion: This publication focuses on comparing two methodological approaches—large-scale propensity score matching (LS-PSM) and large-scale cardinality matching (LS-CM)—for causal inference in observational research. The study evaluates these methods in terms of sample retention, covariate balance, and residual confounding, and proposes a framework for LS-CM. The emphasis is on developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to improve causal inference methodologies, which aligns closely with the goals of methodological research within the OHDSI community. While the study uses clinical data to test the methods, the primary focus is on the methodological comparison and framework development rather than generating clinical evidence.
