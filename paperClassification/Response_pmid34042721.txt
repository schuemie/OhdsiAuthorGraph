Discussion: The publication discusses the adaptation of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to better accommodate data related to rare diseases. It involves the development of a Transition Database for Rare Diseases and a Rare Diseases Dashboard for physicians. The work involves mapping various medical terminologies to OMOP-conform concepts and creating tools for mappings and visualization. This work is primarily focused on improving the OMOP CDM and creating tools to better utilize the data model, which aligns with the first category of "Open community data standards". Although it also involves the creation of software tools, the main focus is not on the development of these tools but on the improvement of the data model, so it does not primarily fall under the third category of "Open source development".

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
