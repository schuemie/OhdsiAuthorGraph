Discussion: This publication discusses the comparison of distinctive phenotyping variables from electronic phenotypes with clinical trial eligibility criteria concepts. The aim is to assess the overlap of phenotype knowledge between them and explore the potential of reusing clinical trial eligibility criteria for phenotyping feature selection. This study does not directly involve the maintenance of the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, or community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, so it does not fall under the first category. It does not involve the creation of software tools, so it does not fall under the third category. It does not conduct network studies to test clinical hypotheses, so it does not fall under the fourth category. However, it does involve the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches, which is characteristic of methodological research, the second category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
