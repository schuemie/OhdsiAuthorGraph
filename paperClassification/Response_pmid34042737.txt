Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a tool for automating the representation of clinical pathways based on the OMOP Common Data Model. This involves the extraction of data, generation of individual sequence of steps, and aggregation of sequence to obtain the population-level diagram. The tool is tested with three surgical procedures. This work involves the use of the OMOP common data model, which is related to the "Open community data standards" category. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development of a new tool, which aligns more with the "Open source development" category. The tool is designed to automate and simplify the visualization of clinical pathways, which is a software development task.

Final category: 3. Open source development
