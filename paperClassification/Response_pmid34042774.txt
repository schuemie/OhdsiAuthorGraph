Discussion: The publication discusses the process of mapping infection control related data across three different standards: openEHR, FHIR, and OMOP CDM. This involves the transformation of data from one format to another to ensure interoperability and maximize analysis capabilities. The focus is on the use of different data models and standards, including the OMOP common data model, to facilitate data exchange and research. This aligns with the first category, which involves maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. Although the publication also touches on the potential for research using the transformed data, the main focus is on the process of data transformation and standardization, rather than the conduct of specific research or the development of software tools.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
