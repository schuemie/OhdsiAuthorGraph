Discussion: This publication discusses the use of medical concept embeddings (MCEs) for feature engineering in phenotyping tasks. It compares the effectiveness of MCEs learned from knowledge graphs and electronic healthcare records (EHR) data. The study uses the observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) common data model, which is related to the first category of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of analytic approaches for feature engineering, which falls under the second category of methodological research. The paper does not seem to involve the creation of software tools or the conduction of network studies to test clinical hypotheses, which are the focus of the third and fourth categories, respectively.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
