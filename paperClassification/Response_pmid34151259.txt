Discussion: This publication discusses the development of a risk prediction model for COVID-19 using electronic health record data. The model is designed to predict an individual's risk for COVID-19 infection based on their health records. The authors used a Credit Scorecard modeling approach on longitudinal EHR data and tested the effects by applying different variable selection techniques such as LASSO and Elastic-Net. The whole pipeline of data processing, risk modeling, and web-based risk calculator can be applied to any EHR data following the OMOP common data format. This suggests that the publication could fall under the categories of "Methodological research" and "Open community data standards". However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of a predictive model, which is more aligned with "Methodological research".

Final category: 2. Methodological research
