Discussion: The publication discusses the adaptation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool to identify social determinants of health from electronic health record data. The tool's outputs are transformed into the OMOP common data model for re-use across many potential use cases. This work involves the use of data standards (OMOP CDM) and the development of a tool (NLP system), which suggests it could fall under both the "Open community data standards" and "Open source development" categories. However, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the adaptation and application of the NLP tool, rather than the data standards themselves.

Final category: 3. Open source development
