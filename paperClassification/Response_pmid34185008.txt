Discussion: The publication discusses a strategy to enable a semantically interoperable clinical data landscape for research in the field of personalized medicine in Switzerland. This strategy involves the use of existing standards and formal descriptive languages for data exchange and interoperability. The work is part of a large Swiss Federal initiative, the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN), which aims to build a national infrastructure for reusing consented data acquired in the health care and research system. The strategy has been implemented in Switzerland and adopted by all university hospitals and high research organizations. This publication does not seem to focus on methodological research, open source development, or clinical evidence generation. Instead, it is more aligned with the category of open community data standards as it discusses the use of existing standards and the development of a strategy for data interoperability.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
