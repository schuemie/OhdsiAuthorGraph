Discussion: The publication discusses a two-stage workflow for extracting and harmonizing drug-related information from clinical notes into observational databases. This process involves the use of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), which is a standard for data organization and representation. The methodology proposed in the paper is aimed at enhancing the value of Electronic Health Records (EHR) databases by incorporating unstructured data from clinical notes, which is typically not used in observational studies due to its complexity. This falls under the scope of maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment, which is category 1: Open community data standards. However, the paper also touches on the development of a new methodology, which could be seen as falling under category 2: Methodological research. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the application and enhancement of existing data standards, rather than the development of new methodologies.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
