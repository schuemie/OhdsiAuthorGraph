Discussion: The publication discusses a retrospective cohort study of US adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). The study evaluates COVID-19 severity and risk factors over time and assesses the use of machine learning to predict clinical severity. The study uses patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities to predict ultimate clinical severity using commonly collected clinical data from the first 24 hours of a hospital admission. This falls under the category of clinical evidence generation as it involves conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization. It also involves predicting outcomes for disease interception and precision medicine.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
