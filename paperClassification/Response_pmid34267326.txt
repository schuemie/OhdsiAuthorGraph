Discussion: The publication presents a cohort study that characterizes and compares the demographics, medical conditions, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients living with obesity to those of patients living without obesity. The study uses data from Spain, the UK, and the US, standardized to the OMOP common data model. The study aims to guide preventive strategies of COVID-19 infection and complications and generate hypotheses for causal inference studies. The use of the OMOP common data model suggests a connection to the "Open community data standards" category. However, the primary focus of the study is on generating clinical evidence about the impact of obesity on COVID-19 outcomes, which aligns with the "Clinical evidence generation" category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
