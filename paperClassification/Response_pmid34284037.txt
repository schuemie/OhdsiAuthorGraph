Discussion: The publication is a study on the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis using a harmonized electronic health record dataset. The study involves testing clinical hypotheses and producing evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization. It does not focus on maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, which would fall under the category of open community data standards. It also does not involve developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics, epidemiology, and informatics, which would be methodological research. Lastly, it does not involve creating software tools that codify best practices and enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes, which would be open source development.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
