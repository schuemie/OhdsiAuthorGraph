Discussion: The publication discusses the evaluation of three feasibility tools for identifying patient data and biospecimen availability. It involves the comparison of the usability of these tools, including OHDSI's ATLAS, and aims to identify the most user-friendly system. This study does not directly involve the development or maintenance of data standards, nor does it conduct network studies to test clinical hypotheses. It does, however, involve the evaluation of software tools, which falls under the category of methodological research. However, the focus is more on the usability and user interface of these tools, which is more related to the development and improvement of these tools, making it more relevant to the category of open source development.

Final category: 3. Open source development
