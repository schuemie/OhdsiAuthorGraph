Discussion: This publication focuses on the use of primary care electronic medical records (EMR) and PCR-confirmed cases to monitor COVID-19 outbreaks and predict hospital admissions, ICU occupancy, and mortality. The study introduces a novel measure, effective potential growth (EPG), for early identification of local outbreaks and evaluates its utility in predicting healthcare outcomes. The work involves generating clinical evidence based on real-world data to characterize disease transmission and outcomes, which aligns with the goals of clinical evidence generation. While the study uses methodological approaches to analyze data, its primary focus is on producing actionable evidence for public health decision-making rather than developing or evaluating new analytic methods or software tools.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
