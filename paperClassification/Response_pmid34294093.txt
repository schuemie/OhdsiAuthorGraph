Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating statistical models (proportional reporting ratio and generalized additive models) to detect adverse drug effects in children, particularly those mediated by ontogenic mechanisms. The study uses simulation to assess the performance of these methods and highlights the opportunity for biologically-inspired detection techniques in pediatric drug safety. The emphasis on developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to improve risk detection methods aligns closely with the goals of methodological research within the OHDSI community. While the study indirectly contributes to clinical evidence generation by addressing adverse drug effects, its primary focus is on the evaluation and development of statistical methodologies rather than conducting network studies or generating clinical evidence directly.
