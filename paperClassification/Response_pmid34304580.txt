Discussion: The publication focuses on a multinational cohort study comparing the effectiveness and safety of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as first-line treatments. This type of research involves generating clinical evidence to characterize treatment utilization and estimate the effects of medical interventions. The study aligns with the goals of clinical evidence generation, as it tests clinical hypotheses and produces evidence relevant to treatment decisions. While the study may utilize standardized data models, methodologies, and open-source tools developed by the OHDSI community, its primary focus is on generating clinical evidence rather than developing standards, methods, or software.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
