Discussion: This publication describes the implementation and evaluation of a "Data Consult Service" aimed at generating clinical evidence in real time to address immediate clinical needs. The focus is on using observational data to answer clinical questions, with an emphasis on challenges such as patient phenotyping, study design, and ensuring the reliability of evidence. While the article touches on methodological aspects (e.g., validated practices for observational research), its primary focus is on generating clinical evidence to support decision-making in real-world scenarios. The study involves conducting analyses to characterize disease, treatment utilization, and patient outcomes, which aligns closely with the goals of clinical evidence generation.
