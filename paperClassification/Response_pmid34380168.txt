Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of electronic health records and questionnaire data to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). It evaluates the feasibility of converting a Singapore-based data source to the OMOP CDM standard and validates the converted data by executing a simple treatment pathways study. This involves the use of the OMOP CDM, which falls under the category of open community data standards. The study also uses Atlas, a tool for conducting analysis on OMOP CDM data, which could potentially fall under the category of open source development. However, the main focus of the paper is on the transformation and standardization of data using the OMOP CDM, which is more aligned with the open community data standards category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
