Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing temporal trends and geographical variation in Dupuytren Disease surgery in England using population-based data. The study uses a longitudinal cohort design and leverages the Hospital Episode Statistics database to generate evidence about disease treatment patterns and disparities in healthcare access. The primary goal is to characterize treatment utilization and identify variations in surgical practices across regions. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study generates evidence about disease treatment and healthcare delivery, which can inform clinical and policy decisions.

While the study does not directly involve developing data standards, methodological research, or open-source tools, it contributes to understanding disease natural history and treatment utilization, which are central to the Clinical evidence generation category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
