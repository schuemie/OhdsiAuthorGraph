Discussion: The publication is a retrospective observational cohort study that uses data from 7 hospitals in Korea, converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. The study investigates the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with lung cancer development. The use of the OMOP Common Data Model suggests a connection to the "Open community data standards" category. However, the main focus of the study is to generate clinical evidence about the association between ACEi and the occurrence of lung cancer, which aligns with the "Clinical evidence generation" category. The study does not seem to involve the development of new analytic approaches or software tools, so the "Methodological research" and "Open source development" categories are less applicable.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
