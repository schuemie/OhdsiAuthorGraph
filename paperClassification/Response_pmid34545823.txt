Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of a semantic mapping from raw genomic data to both FHIR and OMOP CDM, and the analysis of data coverage of both models. This involves the standardization and harmonization of genomic and clinical patient data, which is crucial for supporting international medical research. The paper also discusses the use of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to extend OMOP CDM with patient genomic data. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. Although the paper also mentions the application of different analysis methods including machine learning algorithms on genomic data, the main focus is on the standardization and harmonization of data, which is more related to data standards than methodological research or open source development.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
