Discussion: This publication focuses on modeling the impact of different COVID-19 vaccination strategies, including prioritization choices and dosing intervals, on public health outcomes such as infections, hospitalizations, mortality, and restrictions. The study uses an agent-based cohort model to simulate scenarios and generate evidence about the effects of vaccination strategies. The emphasis is on generating clinical evidence to inform public health decisions, rather than developing new methodologies, software tools, or data standards. The study's primary goal is to produce actionable insights about disease management and intervention strategies, which aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
