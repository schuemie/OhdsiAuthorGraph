Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by conducting a population-based cohort study to investigate the association between atopic eczema, oral corticosteroid use, and fracture risk. The study uses real-world data from English primary care and hospital records to test a clinical hypothesis about the relationship between a medical condition (atopic eczema) and a health outcome (fracture risk), while also exploring the role of a specific treatment (oral corticosteroids) as a potential mediator. The methodology involves statistical analysis (Cox regression) to estimate hazard ratios and adjust for confounders, which aligns with the goal of producing evidence for disease characterization and treatment effects. While the study employs statistical methods, its primary focus is on clinical evidence generation rather than methodological research or open source development.
