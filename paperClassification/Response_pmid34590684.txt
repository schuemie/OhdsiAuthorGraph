Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a pipeline for ingesting, harmonizing, and centralizing data from multiple data partners using Common Data Models. It also discusses the process of data quality review, which involves both automated and manual procedures. The paper also highlights the discovery of several data quality heuristics in the centralized context. This suggests that the paper is primarily concerned with data standards and quality assessment, which falls under the category of "Open community data standards". However, the paper also discusses the use of this data for collaborative analytics to characterize COVID-19 and reduce its impact, which could potentially fall under the category of "Clinical evidence generation". Despite this, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the data standards and quality assessment, rather than the generation of clinical evidence.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
