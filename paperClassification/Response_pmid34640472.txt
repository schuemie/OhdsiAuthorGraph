Discussion: The publication discusses a study that uses the Common Data Model to extract and analyze data from two separate tertiary hospitals. The study aims to estimate the incidence of post-operative hypoparathyroidism in patients who underwent thyroidectomy. The use of the Common Data Model and standardized vocabularies to extract and analyze data suggests that the publication falls under the category of Open community data standards. However, the study also generates clinical evidence by conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization. Therefore, the publication could also fall under the category of Clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
