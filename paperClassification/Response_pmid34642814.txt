Discussion: This publication explores the relationship between elevated blood pressure, antihypertensive medications, and bone health outcomes, such as osteoporosis and fractures. It emphasizes the need for large-scale biomedical data sources and advanced analytical approaches to better understand these associations. The focus on leveraging data and study designs to generate evidence aligns with OHDSI's mission of conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence. While the publication touches on methodological considerations, its primary aim is to generate clinical evidence regarding the effects of blood pressure and antihypertensive medications on bone health outcomes. Therefore, the most appropriate category is "Clinical evidence generation."
