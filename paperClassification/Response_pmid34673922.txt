Discussion: The publication discusses the ASH Research Collaborative, which is a real-world data infrastructure for supporting real-world evidence development and learning healthcare systems in hematology. The Data Hub, one of the major initiatives of the ASH Research Collaborative, uses the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards to construct disease-specific data models. This falls under the category of Open community data standards as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM and standardized vocabularies. However, the publication also discusses the use of these data models to enhance clinical care and test healthcare delivery strategies, which could be seen as Clinical evidence generation. Despite this, the main focus of the publication seems to be on the development and use of the data standards, rather than the generation of clinical evidence.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
