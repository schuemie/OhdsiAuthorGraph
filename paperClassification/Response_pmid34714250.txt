Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of anesthesia data into the OMOP common data model (CDM). It involves the identification of local concepts related to anesthesia and matching them with standard concepts in the OHDSI vocabularies. The process also includes structural mapping between the local anesthesia data warehouse and the OMOP CDM tables and fields. The paper also provides vocabularies, queries, and dashboards to promote the exploitation and sharing of anesthesia data through the CDM. This work is primarily focused on the standardization of EHR data to promote large-scale observational and longitudinal research. Therefore, it aligns with the first category of OHDSI collaboration, which is "Open community data standards". 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
