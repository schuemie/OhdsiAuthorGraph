Discussion: The publication discusses the process of transforming registry data in pulmonary hypertension to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). It highlights the challenges encountered and the solutions devised during the transformation process. The paper also discusses the use of imputation rules for missing dates and the introduction of custom target concepts when existing concepts did not provide sufficient granularity. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. Although the paper also discusses the potential for more efficient collaborations between researchers and the establishment of federated data networks, the main focus is on the standardization of data to the OMOP CDM.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
