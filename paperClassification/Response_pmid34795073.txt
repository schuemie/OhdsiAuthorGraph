Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a FHIR layer on top of the OMOP Common Data Model for the CAPABLE project. This suggests that the publication is about creating a new tool or system, which aligns with the open source development category. However, it also involves the use and modification of the OMOP Common Data Model, which is part of the open community data standards category. While both categories could potentially apply, the focus seems to be more on the development of the FHIR layer, which is a software tool.

Final category: 3. Open source development
