Discussion: The publication discusses the transfer of German claim data, specifically drug data, to the OMOP Common Data Model. It also discusses the implementation of FAIR principles in the OMOP research infrastructure. The paper also addresses data quality issues, which is a key aspect of maintaining data standards. Therefore, the publication seems to be related to the development and maintenance of open community data standards. It does not seem to focus on methodological research, open source development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
