Discussion: The publication discusses the process of making Electronic Health Records (EHRs) reusable through a common framework of data operations. It focuses on the extraction and transformation processes to make the data understandable, reproducible, and auditable. The work aims to standardize the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes for the reuse of EHRs. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. It does not seem to focus on methodological research, open-source development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
