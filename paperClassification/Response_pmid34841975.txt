Discussion: This publication discusses the development and evaluation of methods for combining summary statistics from multiple databases in a distributed research network, specifically in the context of the Cox proportional hazards model. The authors propose and evaluate three new methods to reduce bias when outcome counts are small. They also apply these methods to real-world studies. This work falls under the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches, which is a characteristic of methodological research. It does not directly involve the OMOP common data model, standardized vocabularies, or ETL conventions, which are part of open community data standards. It also does not involve the creation of software tools, which would be open source development. While the methods are applied to clinical studies, the focus of the paper is on the methods themselves, not on the generation of clinical evidence.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
