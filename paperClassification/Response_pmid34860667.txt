Discussion: The publication discusses the challenge of long-term sustainability of open-source software (OSS) developed by the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program. It reviews existing sustainability models and describes 10 OSS use cases, including Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics tools. The paper also recommends essential attributes for research software and actions to be considered in future ITCR activities. This publication is primarily focused on the development, maintenance, and sustainability of open-source software tools, which aligns it with the "Open source development" category. However, it also touches on aspects of "Methodological research" as it discusses the best practices for maintaining and sustaining OSS. Despite this, the main focus is on the development and sustainability of software tools, making "Open source development" the most appropriate category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
