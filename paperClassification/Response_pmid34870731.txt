Discussion: The publication discusses the development and validation of a prediction model for 90-day mortality following a total knee replacement. This involves the use of methodological research to develop the model, as well as the application of this model to generate clinical evidence. The study uses data from a US claims database and a UK general practice database, suggesting the use of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development of the prediction model and its application in a clinical context, which aligns more closely with the categories of methodological research and clinical evidence generation. The paper does not seem to involve the creation of software tools, so the category of open source development does not seem applicable.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
