Discussion: The publication discusses a large-scale experiment to quantify bias, precision, and timeliness of different study designs to estimate historical background compared to post-vaccination rates of safety events for several vaccines. This involves the use of real-world data and past vaccination data. The study also explores methods to improve the comparability of background and post-vaccine rates, including age-sex adjustment and anchoring background rates around a visit. This work is primarily focused on developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches, which aligns with the category of methodological research. It does not primarily focus on maintaining the OMOP common data model or OHDSI standardized vocabularies (category 1), creating software tools (category 3), or conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses (category 4).

Final category: 2. Methodological research
