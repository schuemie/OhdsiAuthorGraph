Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of the MIMIC database into the OMOP common data model. This involves the process of semantic and structural mapping, which is aimed at improving database searching and allowing for the sharing of code, tools, and experience. The publication also evaluates the benefits of this transformation for analysts. This work falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also touches on the aspect of open source development as it involves the creation of a documented, tested, versioned, exemplified, and open repository to support the transformation and improvement of the MIMIC community's source code. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the transformation of the MIMIC database into the OMOP common data model, which is more aligned with the category of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
