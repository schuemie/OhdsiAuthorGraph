Discussion: The publication is a multinational cohort study that characterizes patients with and without prevalent hypertension and COVID-19, and assesses adverse outcomes in both inpatients and outpatients. The study uses healthcare databases from the USA, Europe, and South Korea, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model. The study is focused on generating clinical evidence about the outcomes of COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension. Therefore, it does not seem to be primarily about data standards, methodological research, or open-source development.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
