Discussion: The publication discusses a study that uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model to establish a psychiatric database. The study then uses this database to examine the relationship between suicide risk and various psychological risk factors. This involves the use of methodological research to analyze the data and generate clinical evidence. The study does not seem to involve the development of new software tools or the maintenance of data standards. Therefore, the categories that might apply to this publication are Methodological research and Clinical evidence generation. However, the main focus of the study is on generating clinical evidence about the relationship between suicide risk and psychological risk factors.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
