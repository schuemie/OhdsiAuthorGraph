Discussion: This publication discusses the development and internal validation of prediction models using large observational healthcare data. The authors investigate the impact of different development and validation designs on the performance and generalizability of these models. They also emphasize the importance of using some validation process to select optimal hyperparameters and fairly assess internal validation. This work falls under the scope of developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches, which is characteristic of methodological research. It does not primarily focus on data standards, software development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
