Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by conducting a large-scale, international study to characterize the clinical outcomes and characteristics of COVID-19 patients with and without asthma. The study involves descriptive analysis of patient data from multiple databases across different countries, aiming to provide insights into disease prevalence, comorbidities, and outcomes such as mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The primary goal is to produce evidence that can inform clinical understanding and decision-making regarding asthma patients affected by COVID-19. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on testing clinical hypotheses and producing evidence about disease natural history and treatment outcomes.

Final category: 4
