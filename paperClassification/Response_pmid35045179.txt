Discussion: This publication focuses on assessing trends in the conduct and reporting of clinical prediction model development and validation, particularly using electronic health record (EHR) data. It evaluates the quality of reporting and the extent to which information necessary for external validation is provided. While the study does not directly develop new methodologies or software tools, it critically examines the practices surrounding clinical prediction models, which aligns with methodological research aimed at improving scientific best practices in informatics and statistics. The focus on improving reporting standards and validation processes suggests that the publication contributes to the refinement of methodologies for clinical prediction modeling.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
