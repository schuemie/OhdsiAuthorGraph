Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of an ETL tool that converts data from the PCORnet CDM format into the OMOP CDM format. This falls under the scope of creating tools to facilitate data conversion and interoperability, which is a key aspect of maintaining open community data standards. The tool is also open-source, which aligns with the principles of open source development. However, the primary focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of the ETL tool for data standardization and interoperability, rather than the development of the software itself.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
