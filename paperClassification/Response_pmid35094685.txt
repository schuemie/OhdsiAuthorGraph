Discussion: This publication discusses the development and validation of a personalized risk calculator for COVID-19 outcomes using historical influenza data. The authors used a two-step process to develop three scores using LASSO regularized logistic regression and then validated these scores on patients with influenza or flu-like symptoms and confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis. The study involves the use of statistical methods and data analysis, which aligns with the category of methodological research. However, it also involves the generation of clinical evidence through the testing of the developed models on COVID-19 patients, which aligns with the category of clinical evidence generation. While the study does involve some elements of open source development, such as the creation of the COVER scores, the main focus of the paper is not on the development of software tools. The study does not seem to involve open community data standards as it does not discuss the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, or community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
