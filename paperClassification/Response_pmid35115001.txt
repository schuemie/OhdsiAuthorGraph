Discussion: This publication discusses the replication and optimization of a Temporal Pattern Discovery (TPD) approach previously used to assess temporal signals of statins with rhabdomyolysis using OHDSI tools designed for OMOP data sources. The study involves the use of electronic healthcare databases for signal detection of adverse drug events, which is a methodological approach. The authors also mention the modification of existing OHDSI software for faster queries and more efficient generation of chronographs, which indicates some level of open source development. However, the main focus of the paper is on the evaluation of the performance of the TPD method, suggesting that it falls primarily under methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
