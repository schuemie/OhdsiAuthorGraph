Discussion: This publication focuses on patient-reported experiences and satisfaction during the process of switching from Humira to biosimilar adalimumab. It emphasizes the importance of communication, training, and information provision in optimizing patient outcomes. The study involves analyzing survey data to generate evidence about patient perceptions and outcomes related to a clinical intervention (switching to a biosimilar). This aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence characterizing treatment utilization and its effects on patient satisfaction and outcomes. While the study does not directly involve methodological research, open source development, or data standards, it contributes to understanding the real-world implications of clinical practices.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
