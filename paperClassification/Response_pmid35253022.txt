Discussion: The publication discusses the development of geodatabase functions that utilize differential privacy for privacy-aware geospatial analysis of healthcare data. This involves the integration of an open-source library for differential privacy into a workflow for leveraging a geodatabase for geocoding and analyzing geospatial data stored as part of the OMOP common data model. This falls under the development of software tools that enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes, which is characteristic of the "Open source development" category. However, it also touches on the maintenance of the OMOP common data model, which is a characteristic of the "Open community data standards" category. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the development of the geodatabase functions, making "Open source development" the most appropriate category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
