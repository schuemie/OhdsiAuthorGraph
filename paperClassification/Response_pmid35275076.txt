Discussion: This publication discusses the conversion of fall-related electronic health record data into the standardized Observational Medical Outcome Partnership's (OMOP) common data model format. It also discusses the development of models that predict fall risk during two time periods. The conversion of data into a standardized format aligns with the "Open community data standards" category. However, the development and application of predictive models to clinical data for the purpose of generating evidence for fall risk prediction aligns more with the "Clinical evidence generation" category. 

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
