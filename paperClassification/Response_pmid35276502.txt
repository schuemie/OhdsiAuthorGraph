Discussion: The publication discusses the use of OHDSI's Common Data Model (CDM) to characterize adult patients with epilepsy and their antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment pathways. The study validates a phenotype algorithm for epilepsy in adults using the CDM in an electronic health record (EHR)-derived database. It also discusses the variability in ASM use in practice and the potential of multi-center OHDSI studies to better characterize this variability and support observational comparative effectiveness research. This suggests that the publication falls under the categories of open community data standards and clinical evidence generation. However, the main focus of the study is on using the CDM to generate clinical evidence about ASM treatment pathways in epilepsy, which makes it more aligned with the category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
