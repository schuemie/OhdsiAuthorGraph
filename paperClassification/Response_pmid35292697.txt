Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP Common Data Model to analyze treatment patterns for Alzheimer's dementia in South Korea. It involves the analysis of real-world data to understand the utilization and persistence of anti-dementia medications. While the study uses the OMOP CDM, which is related to open community data standards, the main focus of the paper is on generating clinical evidence about treatment patterns in Alzheimer's dementia. Therefore, the study does not primarily contribute to the development or maintenance of data standards, but rather uses these standards to generate clinical evidence.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
