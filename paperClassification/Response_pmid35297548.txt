Discussion: The publication discusses the Beacon protocol, a data discovery tool designed to facilitate the sharing of human genomic data. The paper specifically discusses the improvements made in version 2 of the protocol, which better serves the needs of clinical genomics research and healthcare. The protocol is designed to work alongside popular standards like Phenopackets, OMOP, or FHIR. This suggests that the publication could fall under the category of "Open community data standards" as it discusses the integration of the Beacon protocol with the OMOP standard. However, the paper also seems to touch on "Clinical evidence generation" as it discusses the application of the protocol in clinical genomics research and healthcare. Despite this, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the development and improvement of the Beacon protocol, which suggests that it is primarily concerned with data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
