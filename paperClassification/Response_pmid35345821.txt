Discussion: The publication discusses the use of real-world data to understand the characteristics and trends in COVID-19 progression, management, and evolution over time. The study uses a large-scale dataset and a standardized framework for analysis. This involves the use of data standards and methodologies to conduct a descriptive retrospective database study. However, the primary focus of the paper is on generating clinical evidence about COVID-19, including its progression, management, and evolution over time. Therefore, while aspects of open community data standards and methodological research are involved, the main focus is on clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
