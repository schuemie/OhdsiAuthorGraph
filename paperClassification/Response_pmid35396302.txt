Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of mental health disorders in Catalonia, Spain. The study uses a population-based cohort design and leverages a large primary care database to assess trends in anxiety and depressive disorders over different periods of the pandemic. The primary goal is to characterize disease patterns and provide insights into how the pandemic influenced mental health diagnoses. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence about disease natural history and treatment utilization during a specific public health crisis.

While the study uses statistical methods (e.g., negative binomial regression models) to forecast rates and compare observed versus expected events, the focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodological approaches, which would fall under **Methodological research**. Similarly, the study does not involve the creation or maintenance of data standards or open-source tools, ruling out the **Open community data standards** and **Open source development** categories.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
