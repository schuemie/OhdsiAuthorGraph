Discussion: The publication focuses on the development and evaluation of Criteria2Query (C2Q) 2.0, a tool that combines human and machine intelligence to convert clinical trial eligibility criteria into cohort queries. This involves creating software that integrates natural language processing (NLP) techniques with user-friendly features for real-time human intervention. The study evaluates the tool's performance in terms of accuracy, usability, and user engagement, which aligns with the creation of software tools to enable consistent and reproducible processes. While the tool indirectly supports clinical evidence generation by facilitating cohort query creation, the primary focus is on the development and evaluation of the software itself, making it most relevant to open source development.

Final category: 3. Open source development
