Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and evaluation of predictive models using logistic regression on large observational datasets. It empirically assesses the impact of sample size on model performance and complexity, providing guidance on how to balance computational efficiency with predictive accuracy. The study involves methodological exploration of learning curves and sample size considerations, which are central to improving predictive modeling practices. This aligns closely with the goals of **methodological research**, as the work seeks to establish scientific best practices for predictive modeling in observational health data.

While the study indirectly contributes to clinical evidence generation by addressing prediction problems in specific cohorts (depression and hypertension), its primary focus is on the methodology of model development rather than generating clinical evidence itself. Additionally, the publication does not directly involve the creation of open-source tools or standards, which would align it with the categories of open source development or open community data standards.

Final category: **2. Methodological research**
