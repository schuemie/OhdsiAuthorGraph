Discussion: The publication discusses the Haematology Outcomes Network in Europe (HONEUR), a federated data network that uses the OMOP common data model to analyze data from various sources. This involves the use of open community data standards to ensure data compatibility and interoperability. The publication also mentions the use of this data for research studies to increase knowledge and understanding of the management of patients with hematologic malignancies, which falls under the category of clinical evidence generation. However, the main focus of the paper is on the use of the OMOP common data model and the creation of a federated data network, which is more related to the establishment and use of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
