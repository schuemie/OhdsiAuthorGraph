Discussion: This publication focuses on the use of unstructured text in developing and validating clinical prognostic prediction models. It systematically reviews the methodological landscape, evaluates the added value of text data in prediction models, and highlights areas for improvement, such as explainability and external validation. The emphasis on assessing and summarizing methodological approaches to improve prediction performance aligns closely with the goals of methodological research within the OHDSI community. While the study indirectly contributes to clinical evidence generation by discussing prediction models, its primary focus is on evaluating and improving analytic methods, which is characteristic of methodological research.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
