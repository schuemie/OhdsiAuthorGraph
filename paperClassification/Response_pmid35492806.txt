Discussion: This publication focuses on a cost-effectiveness analysis of a Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) compared to standard care for the secondary prevention of fragility fractures in Spain. The study uses a Markov model to simulate disease progression and evaluates clinical, economic, and quality-of-life outcomes. The primary goal is to generate evidence about the clinical and economic benefits of implementing FLS in the Spanish healthcare system. This aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence characterizing treatment utilization and estimating the effects of medical interventions (FLS vs. standard care) for comparative effectiveness. While the study involves methodological aspects (e.g., Markov modeling and sensitivity analyses), its primary focus is on generating actionable clinical evidence rather than advancing methodological research or developing open-source tools.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
