Discussion: The publication is a retrospective multicenter study that uses the Common Data Model (CDM) to examine the long-term safety of liothyronine (LT3) therapy in Asian populations. The study compares the safety outcomes of LT3 users with those of levothyroxine (LT4)-only users. The results of the study indicate that the use of LT3 is associated with an increased incidence of heart failure and stroke in patients with a longer duration of LT3 use and history of thyroid cancer. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of clinical evidence generation as it conducts a network study to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization. Although the study uses the Common Data Model, which is related to open community data standards, the main focus of the publication is not on maintaining or developing these standards but on using them to generate clinical evidence.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
