Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a framework for identifying temporal clinical event trajectories from Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-formatted observational healthcare data. This framework is implemented as an open-source R package, which falls under the category of open source development. However, the paper also discusses the application of this framework to a population-based Estonian dataset, which could be seen as clinical evidence generation. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development and implementation of the software tool, which makes it more appropriate to categorize it under open source development.

Final category: 3. Open source development
