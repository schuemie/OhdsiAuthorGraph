Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to convert Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) into a standardized format that can be used for benefit-risk assessments of medicinal products. This involves the use of standardized vocabularies and data structures, which falls under the category of Open community data standards. However, the study also involves the generation of clinical evidence through the analysis of real-world data from Singapore and South Korea, which falls under the category of Clinical evidence generation. The study does not seem to involve the development of new analytic approaches (Methodological research) or the creation of new software tools (Open source development).

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
