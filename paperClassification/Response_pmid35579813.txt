Discussion: This publication focuses on the application of machine learning (ML) techniques within distributed data networks (DDNs) for pharmacoepidemiologic and pharmacovigilance studies. It discusses opportunities, challenges, and considerations for using ML in these contexts, emphasizing the role of DDNs in facilitating multi-database studies and addressing practical data-related factors. While the paper touches on methodological aspects of ML and its application in DDNs, the primary focus appears to be on generating clinical evidence related to pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacovigilance, which aligns with the goals of clinical evidence generation. The discussion of ML techniques and their challenges in DDNs could also be relevant to methodological research, as it involves evaluating analytic approaches. However, the emphasis on using ML to address clinical questions and generate evidence suggests that the publication is most closely aligned with the clinical evidence generation category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
