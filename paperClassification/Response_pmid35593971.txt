Discussion: The publication discusses the development and training of prediction models to assess the individual risk of postoperative complications after colorectal cancer surgery. The models are based on preoperative data and aim to improve decision-making and individualize surgical treatment trajectories. The data used for this study was converted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model maintained by the Observation Health Data Science and Informatics initiative. This suggests that the publication could fall under the category of "Open community data standards". However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of predictive models, which is more aligned with "Methodological research". The paper also mentions the generation of clinical evidence through the use of these models, which could suggest a fit with "Clinical evidence generation". However, the primary focus is not on the generation of clinical evidence but on the development and evaluation of the predictive models.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
