Discussion: The publication discusses a study that compares the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) among patients using different types of statins. The study uses data from electronic health records from ten hospitals, which have been converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. The study then conducts a cohort study using Cox regression analysis to examine the hazard ratio (HR) of NODM after propensity score matching (PSM). The results of the study are then analyzed through an aggregate meta-analysis of the HR. This publication falls under the category of clinical evidence generation as it conducts a network study to test a clinical hypothesis and produce evidence about the effects of different medical interventions (statins) on the risk of NODM.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
