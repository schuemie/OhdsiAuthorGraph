Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) for storing and using patient data in an international context, specifically focusing on detailed medical microbiology laboratory data. The authors propose a solution to handle the complexity of microbiology data and demonstrate the feasibility of their approach. This falls under the category of Open community data standards as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also touches on Open source development as it involves creating a solution for a specific data handling issue. Despite this, the main focus is on the use and adaptation of the OMOP CDM, making Open community data standards the most appropriate category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
