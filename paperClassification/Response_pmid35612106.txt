Discussion: The publication discusses the process of harmonizing national real world data (RWD) for international research using standard terminologies. It specifically evaluates the coverage of the German OPS vocabulary in OHDSI and its mapping to SNOMED-CT. This process involves the use of the OMOP common data model and OHDSI standardized vocabularies, which are key components of the open community data standards. Therefore, the publication falls under the category of open community data standards. However, it also touches on the challenges of data harmonization, which could be seen as a methodological research issue. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the use and evaluation of data standards, making the open community data standards category the most appropriate.

Final category: Open community data standards
