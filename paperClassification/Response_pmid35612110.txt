Discussion: The publication discusses the development of the Medical Imaging Data Structure (MIDS), an extension of the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) to accommodate multiple anatomical regions and imaging systems. This work involves creating a standard for organizing and managing medical imaging data, which aligns with the first category of open community data standards. However, it also involves the creation of a tool, which could potentially fall under the third category of open source development. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper seems to be on the establishment of a new standard for data organization and management, rather than the development of the tool itself.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
