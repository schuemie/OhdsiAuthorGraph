Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and evaluation of ensemble approaches to improve the transportability of patient-level prediction models across multiple healthcare databases. The study investigates methodological approaches for combining models developed independently on different databases and evaluates their performance in terms of discrimination and calibration. The emphasis is on improving the predictive accuracy and consistency of prognostic models when applied to unseen databases, which aligns with the development and empirical evaluation of analytic methods in statistics and informatics. This work does not directly involve creating software tools (open source development), maintaining data standards (open community data standards), or generating clinical evidence through network studies (clinical evidence generation). Instead, it is primarily concerned with advancing methodological research in predictive modeling.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
