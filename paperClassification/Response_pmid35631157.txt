Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP CDM and other OHDSI tools to facilitate a retrospective study in a research network. It involves the use of an ETL process to transfer and harmonize data, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the study also involves the generation of clinical evidence related to COVID-19 and diabetes-related eye diseases, which falls under the category of clinical evidence generation. While the study does involve the use of software tools, it does not appear to involve the creation of new tools, so the category of open source development may not be applicable. The study does not seem to involve the development or evaluation of new analytic approaches, so the category of methodological research may not be applicable either.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
