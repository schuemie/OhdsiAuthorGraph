Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a new natural language processing tool, DECOVRI, which is designed to extract COVID-19 related information from clinical text notes. This tool is intended to convert unstructured notes into structured data within an OMOP CDM-based ecosystem. This falls under the creation of software tools, which is part of the open source development category. However, it also involves the use of the OMOP common data model, which is part of the open community data standards category. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the development of the software tool, making the open source development category more appropriate.

Final category: 3. Open source development
