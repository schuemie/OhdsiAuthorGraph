Discussion: The publication discusses the LEGEND-T2DM initiative, which is a series of large-scale, multinational, real-world comparative cardiovascular effectiveness and safety studies of second-line anti-hyperglycaemic agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study leverages the OHDSI community and its global network of administrative claims and electronic health record data sources. The study aims to examine the relative risk of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of different T2DM agents. The study also ensures data safety through a federated analytic approach and follows research best practices, including prespecification and full disclosure of results. The study is dedicated to open science and transparency and will publicly share all analytic code from reproducible cohort definitions through turn-key software. This publication could potentially fall under the categories of "Methodological research" as it develops and evaluates analytic approaches, "Open source development" as it creates software tools that enable consistent and reproducible processes, and "Clinical evidence generation" as it conducts network studies to produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization. However, the primary focus of the publication is on conducting network studies to generate clinical evidence, making it most appropriate for the "Clinical evidence generation" category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
