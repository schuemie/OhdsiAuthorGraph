Discussion: This publication presents a large-scale network cohort study that investigates the trends in the use of different oral anticoagulants among patients with atrial fibrillation in different countries. The study uses data from nine databases that have been converted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model and the analysis was performed using open-source analytical tools. This suggests that the study involves elements of open community data standards and open source development. However, the main focus of the study is on generating clinical evidence about the use of oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this publication is clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
