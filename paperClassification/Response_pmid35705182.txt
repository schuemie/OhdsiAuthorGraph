Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of thyroid cancer diagnosis and staging information from unstructured reports to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). This involves the use of natural language processing (NLP) to extract relevant information from free-text medical reports. The study aims to standardize thyroid cancer-specific data for retrospective observational research and participation in multicenter studies. This work aligns with the first category of open community data standards as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. It also touches on the third category of open source development as it involves creating software tools (NLP in this case) to enable the community to execute analyses. However, the main focus of the paper is on the transformation and standardization of data using the OMOP CDM, which falls under the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
