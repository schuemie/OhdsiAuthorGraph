Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by quantifying the background incidence rates of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) associated with COVID-19 vaccines across multiple countries. The study uses electronic health records and health claims data mapped to the OMOP common data model, and the findings are stratified by age, sex, and database. The primary goal is to provide evidence that can inform safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness research related to COVID-19 vaccines. While the study leverages the OMOP common data model (which is part of the open community data standards), its primary focus is on clinical evidence generation rather than the development or maintenance of data standards, methodological research, or open-source software tools.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
