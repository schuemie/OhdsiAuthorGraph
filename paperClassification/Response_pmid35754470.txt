Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing trends in opioid use, dispensations, and morphine milligram equivalents in Catalonia, Spain, over a 12-year period. The study uses a population-based cohort to generate evidence about opioid utilization patterns, stratified by demographic and socioeconomic factors. The primary goal is to characterize the natural history of opioid use and identify changes in prescribing practices, particularly the shift toward chronic and strong opioid prescriptions for non-cancer pain. This type of research aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as it involves conducting a network study to produce evidence about treatment utilization and prescribing trends, which can inform public health policies and clinical practices.

While the study does not focus on developing new methodologies, software tools, or data standards, it contributes to the generation of clinical evidence, making it most appropriate for classification under the fourth category.

Final category: 4
