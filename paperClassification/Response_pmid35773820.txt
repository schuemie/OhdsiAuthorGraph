Discussion: The publication discusses the development of the Medical Imaging Data Structure (MIDS), which extends the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) methodology to other anatomical regions and multiple imaging systems. This work involves creating a standard for organizing and managing medical imaging data, which aligns with the first category of open community data standards. However, it also involves the development of a tool, which could potentially fall under the third category of open source development. The publication does not seem to involve methodological research or clinical evidence generation as it does not discuss the empirical evaluation of analytic approaches or the conduction of network studies to test clinical hypotheses.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
