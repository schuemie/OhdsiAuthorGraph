Discussion: This publication is focused on the empirical assessment of different methods for identifying seasonality in observational healthcare data. The study compares various methods for determining the seasonality of a time series and evaluates their concordance when applied to different health databases. The results highlight the inconsistency of these methods and the potential impact of the chosen method on the generalizability of the research. This work is primarily concerned with the development and evaluation of analytic approaches, which aligns with the category of methodological research. It does not directly involve the maintenance of data standards, the creation of software tools, or the generation of clinical evidence.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
