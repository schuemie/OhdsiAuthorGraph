Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP common data model (CDM) to identify common concepts recorded in a study of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and adverse events. The study also discusses the challenges of mapping different terminologies used across the United Kingdom's health services. This involves the use of OHDSI's ATHENA online browser for terminology harmonization. The publication falls under the first category of "Open community data standards" as it involves maintaining the OMOP CDM and OHDSI standardized vocabularies. It also touches on the third category of "Open source development" as it uses OHDSI's ATHENA tool. However, the main focus of the publication is on the use and maintenance of the OMOP CDM and standardized vocabularies, making the first category the most appropriate.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
