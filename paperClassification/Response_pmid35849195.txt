Discussion: This publication discusses the development of prediction models for short-term mortality after surgery for colorectal cancer using data from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group database. The data was transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, which suggests that the work involves Open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of predictive models, which is a form of Methodological research. The paper does not seem to involve the creation of new software tools, so Open source development is not applicable. While the study does generate clinical evidence, it is more focused on the methodological aspect of developing and evaluating predictive models rather than testing clinical hypotheses or estimating the effects of medical interventions, so Clinical evidence generation may not be the most appropriate category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
