Discussion: The publication discusses the design and approach to encode social determinants of health (SDoH) data into the National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) OMOP dataset. This involves creating a system for data mapping and ingestion for patient-level SDoH. The focus is on improving the interoperability of these data, which are typically stored as non-standard, EHR vendor specific codes. This work aligns with the open community data standards category as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model and creating community conventions for data transformation and quality assessment. It also touches on the open source development category as it involves creating a system to enable consistent and reproducible processes. However, the main focus is on data standards and conventions, making the open community data standards category the most appropriate.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
