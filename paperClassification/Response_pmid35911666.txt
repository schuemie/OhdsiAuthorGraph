Discussion: This publication discusses the development of an ordinal severity scale (OS) for assessing COVID-19 patient outcomes using retrospective Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The OS is based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the application of this scale to understand the progression of COVID-19 disease severity over time, which is more related to clinical evidence generation. The paper also involves some methodological research, as it uses principal component analysis to characterize changes in disease severity. However, the primary focus is not on the development or evaluation of this method, but rather on its application to generate clinical evidence.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
