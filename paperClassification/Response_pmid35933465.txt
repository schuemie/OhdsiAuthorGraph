Discussion: The publication discusses the development and implementation of an anesthesia data warehouse, which is mainly fed with data collected by the anesthesia information management system and hospital discharge reports. The authors have implemented their data warehouse into the OMOP common data model, which is a key aspect of the "Open community data standards" category. However, the paper also discusses the lessons learned from the project and provides guidance for similar projects, which could be seen as part of the "Methodological research" category. The paper also mentions the future goal of disseminating the use of the OMOP data model for anesthesia and critical care, and driving the trend towards federated learning to enhance collaborations and multicenter studies, which could be seen as part of the "Clinical evidence generation" category. However, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the development and implementation of the data warehouse, which is most closely aligned with the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
