Discussion: The publication discusses the use of artificial intelligence and data science techniques to harmonize, share, access, and analyze SARS-COV-2/COVID-19 data in Rwanda. The project involves the use of OHDSI's open-source tools to harmonize hospital electronic health records (EHRs) through the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). This suggests that the publication falls under the category of "Open community data standards". However, the publication also discusses the use of these tools for data analytics and network integration, which suggests that it could also fall under the category of "Open source development". The ultimate outcome of the project is the dynamic prediction modeling for the COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda, which suggests that it could also fall under the category of "Clinical evidence generation". However, the main focus of the publication is on the use of OHDSI's tools to harmonize data, which suggests that the most appropriate category is "Open community data standards".

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
