Discussion: The publication discusses the development and application of a semi-automated method to improve the quality of vaccine concept mappings in the OMOP vocabulary, which is part of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The focus is on ensuring the accuracy and consistency of these mappings, which are crucial for integrating and standardizing medical concepts across various clinical domains. This work is related to maintaining and improving the OMOP CDM and its standardized vocabularies, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, it also involves the development of a new method, which could be seen as methodological research. Despite this, the primary focus seems to be on improving the existing data standards rather than developing new methodologies.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
