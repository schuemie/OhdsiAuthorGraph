Discussion: This publication focuses on comparing the severity of infections between the omicron and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2, using a large cohort from the Catalan Health Care System. The study involves analyzing hospitalization and ICU admission rates, stratified by age and vaccination status, and employs statistical models to estimate transmissibility and severity reduction. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about the natural history and impact of these variants, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation. While the study uses statistical methods and models, its focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies, nor does it involve creating open-source tools or data standards.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
