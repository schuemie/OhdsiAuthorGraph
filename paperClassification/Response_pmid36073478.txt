Discussion: The publication discusses a secure architecture to share information from distributed databases without compromising the subjects' privacy. It specifically mentions the use of the OMOP CDM data schema, which is a part of the OHDSI's open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is not on maintaining or developing these standards, but rather on a method to preserve privacy when querying these databases. This suggests that the paper is more aligned with methodological research, as it is developing and proposing a new approach to a problem. It could also potentially fall under open source development if the authors are creating a new tool or software to implement this secure architecture. However, without more information on whether a specific tool or software is being developed, it is safer to classify this under methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
