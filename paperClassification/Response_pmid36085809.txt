Discussion: The publication discusses the implementation of a standardized data access standard, FHIR, and the conversion of existing data in the OMOP Common Data Model into FHIR data elements. This falls under the category of maintaining data standards. However, the publication also discusses the development of applications leveraging these data elements, which falls under the category of open source development. The main focus of the paper seems to be on the implementation of these standards and tools to facilitate research, which could be seen as a form of clinical evidence generation. However, the primary focus is not on conducting network studies or producing evidence, but rather on the tools and standards that enable such research.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
