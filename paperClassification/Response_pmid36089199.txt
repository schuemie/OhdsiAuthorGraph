Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of a system called FHIR-Ontop-OMOP, which generates virtual clinical knowledge graphs from the OMOP relational databases. This involves the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) to standardize EHR data for clinical data analytics. This falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the maintenance and application of the OMOP CDM and OHDSI standardized vocabularies. However, it also involves the creation of a software tool, which could place it under "Open source development". Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the use of data standards to enable the creation of these knowledge graphs, rather than the development of the software tool itself.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
