Discussion: The publication discusses the development and comparison of computable phenotypes for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model. This involves the use of electronic health record (EHR) data and the application of algorithms to identify DRE. The study aims to enable large-scale, real-world comparative effectiveness research and improve access to specialized epilepsy care. This falls under the category of methodological research as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches. However, it also touches on open community data standards as it utilizes the OMOP Common Data Model. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of the method for identifying DRE, making methodological research the most appropriate category.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
