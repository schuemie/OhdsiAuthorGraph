Discussion: The publication focuses on addressing confounding in causal inference using observational data, specifically through the large-scale propensity score (LSPS) approach. It examines the theoretical conditions under which LSPS can adjust for indirectly measured confounders and evaluates its performance using simulated and real medical data. This work is centered on developing and empirically evaluating analytic methods for causal inference, which aligns with the goals of methodological research. While the study may indirectly contribute to clinical evidence generation by improving causal inference methods, its primary focus is on advancing methodological approaches rather than conducting network studies or generating clinical evidence directly. It does not focus on open community data standards or open-source software development.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
