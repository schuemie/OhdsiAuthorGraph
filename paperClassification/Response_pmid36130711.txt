Discussion: The publication discusses the development of an automated text data conversion algorithm, ECG2CDM, that converts diagnostic statements from 12-lead ECG tests into the OMOP CDM terminology. This falls under the process of extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment, which is part of the open community data standards. However, the development of the ECG2CDM algorithm also involves creating a software tool, which is part of open source development. While both categories could apply, the main focus of the publication is on the conversion of ECG data into the OMOP CDM, which is more closely related to the open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
