Discussion: The publication discusses the harmonization of patient data from different disease registries for federated analyses. It provides a blueprint for how a clinical research collaboration can successfully use real-world data from existing disease registries. This involves transforming nonstandardized clinical registry data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. The publication also discusses the challenges and lessons learned in setting up a federated data network. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also touches on the use of this data for clinical research, which could fall under the category of clinical evidence generation. Given the primary focus of the publication is on data harmonization and standardization, the most appropriate category would be open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
