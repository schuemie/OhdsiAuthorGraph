Discussion: This publication discusses the development and validation of a reference standard for adverse drug reaction (RS-ADR) signal assessment. The study integrates well-known reference sets for drug-ADR pairs and uses controlled vocabularies to annotate EHR data. The RS-ADR is then used to detect and validate novel ADR signals. This work involves the use of real-world data and the creation of a pharmacovigilance dictionary, which aligns with the open community data standards category. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and validation of a method for ADR signal assessment, which falls under the methodological research category. The paper does not seem to involve the creation of software tools (open source development) or the conduction of network studies to test clinical hypotheses (clinical evidence generation).

Final category: 2. Methodological research
