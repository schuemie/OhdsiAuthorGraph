Discussion: The publication discusses the adaptation and validation of a coding algorithm for the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) using the SNOMED CT standardized vocabulary. This involves the translation of the Quan coding algorithms and manual curation by clinical experts. The performance of the SNOMED CT and Quan coding algorithms were compared in a retrospective cohort study. This work involves the use of standardized vocabularies and coding algorithms, which are key components of data standards. Therefore, it aligns with the "Open community data standards" category. Although the study involves some methodological aspects, the main focus is on the adaptation of a coding algorithm to a standardized vocabulary, which is more related to data standards than methodological research.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
