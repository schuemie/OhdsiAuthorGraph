Discussion: The publication discusses the standardization of electronic health record (EHR) ventilation data for children using long-term mechanical ventilation. The authors propose a framework for standardizing these data using a common data model (CDM) across multiple populations and sites. They also discuss the integration of this framework into the PEDSnet CDM based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP). This work involves the creation and maintenance of data standards, specifically for ventilation data in the EHR. Therefore, it aligns with the "Open community data standards" category. Although the work also involves some aspects of methodological research and open source development, the main focus is on data standardization, which makes the "Open community data standards" category the most appropriate.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
