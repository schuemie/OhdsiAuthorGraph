Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of the UK Biobank data to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to enable efficient international federated analyses, particularly for COVID-19 research. The process involved converting participant research data on diseases, electronic health records, and other health-related data using different controlled clinical terminologies and bespoke mappings. The authors also performed syntactic and semantic validations and compared comorbidities and risk factors between the source and transformed data. This work aligns with the first category, "Open community data standards," as it involves maintaining the OMOP CDM, using standardized vocabularies, and establishing community conventions for data transformation and quality assessment. However, the authors also identified challenges in transforming data from questionnaires to the OMOP CDM, which suggests an element of methodological research. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on data standardization and transformation, making the first category the most appropriate.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
