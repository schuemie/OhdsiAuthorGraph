Discussion: This publication presents an observational cohort study that investigates the effectiveness of Coronary Artery Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) screening on Cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) outcomes. The study uses the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics' Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) data and the population-level estimation method. The study does not focus on maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment, so it does not fall under the first category. It does not focus on developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics, epidemiology, and informatics, so it does not fall under the second category. It does not focus on creating software tools that codify best practices and enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes, so it does not fall under the third category. The study does focus on conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, estimating effects of medical interventions for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness, and predicting outcomes for disease interception and precision medicine, so it falls under the fourth category.
Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
