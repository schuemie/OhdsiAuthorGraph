Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) for data harmonization across multiple clinical sites, particularly in the field of cancer prediction. It reviews the potential of the OMOP CDM and the genomic vocabulary extension in facilitating data-driven studies and AI-based predictions in cancer research. The paper also evaluates the use of the OMOP CDM in predictive analyses in cancer and the underlying predictive models/tools. This publication seems to touch on aspects of open community data standards (category 1) as it discusses the OMOP CDM and its role in data standardization. It also delves into clinical evidence generation (category 4) as it reviews the use of the OMOP CDM in predictive analyses in cancer. However, the main focus of the paper is on the use and potential of the OMOP CDM in standardizing data for cancer prediction studies, which aligns more with category 1.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
