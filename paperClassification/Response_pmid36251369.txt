Discussion: The publication discusses a standardized description of the feature extraction process for enhancing data reuse in retrospective observational studies. It also proposes two tables "TRACK" and "FEATURE" to extend the OMOP common data model (CDM). This work involves the transformation of raw data into meaningful information, which is a key aspect of data standards. Therefore, it could fall under the category of "Open community data standards". However, it also involves the development of a new method for data transformation and storage, which could be seen as "Methodological research". Despite this, the primary focus of the paper seems to be on standardizing the process of data transformation for enhancing data reuse, which is more aligned with the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
