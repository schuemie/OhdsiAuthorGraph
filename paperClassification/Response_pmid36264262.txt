Discussion: The publication discusses the integration of real-world data from Brazil and Pakistan into the OMOP common data model and the use of a standardized health analytics framework to characterize COVID-19 in the Global South. This involves the harmonization of patient-level COVID-19 records from various sources to the OMOP common data model and the use of a federated network analytics framework for analysis. This falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of the OMOP common data model and standardized vocabularies. However, it also involves the generation of clinical evidence related to COVID-19, which falls under the category of "Clinical evidence generation". Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the use of the OMOP common data model and standardized health analytics framework, making "Open community data standards" the most appropriate category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
