Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model (CDM) to estimate compliance with the selective leukoreduction protocol (SLP) in three hospitals. The study involves the analysis of large datasets and the classification of patients into different groups based on their medical conditions and treatments. The findings of the study are used to suggest improvements in the implementation of the SLP. This publication seems to fall under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM for data analysis. However, it also touches on "Clinical evidence generation" as it generates evidence about the compliance with a medical protocol in different patient groups. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the use of the CDM for data analysis, making "Open community data standards" the most appropriate category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
