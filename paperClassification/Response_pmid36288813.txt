Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by conducting a multinational network cohort study to compare the risks of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome and thromboembolic events associated with different COVID-19 vaccines. The study uses routinely collected health data from multiple countries and applies statistical methods such as propensity score matching and meta-analyses to estimate incidence rate ratios and differences. The primary goal is to produce evidence that informs vaccine safety and guides public health decisions. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on testing clinical hypotheses and estimating the effects of medical interventions (COVID-19 vaccines) for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness.

While the study employs methodological approaches and statistical techniques, its primary focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies, nor does it involve open community data standards or open-source software development. Therefore, the other categories are less applicable.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
