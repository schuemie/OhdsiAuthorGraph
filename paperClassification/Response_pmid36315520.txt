Discussion: The publication discusses the development and validation of a clinical information extraction algorithm, TED-PC, to detect the time of clinical events relative to gestational weeks using EHR data. The algorithm was developed using EHR data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), which is normalized by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). The algorithm was tested for content validity and clinical validity, and was found to have excellent accuracy in inferring gestational age and delivery dates. This work could fall under the categories of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM, "Methodological research" as it involves the development and validation of a new algorithm, and "Open source development" if the algorithm is made available for use by the community. However, the main focus of the work is on the development and validation of the algorithm, which makes it most closely aligned with "Methodological research".

Final category: 2. Methodological research
