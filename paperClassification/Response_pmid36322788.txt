Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a federated infrastructure model (CO-CONNECT) to enable the automated and reproducible mapping of health data partners' pseudonymized data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. This is done without the need for any data to leave the data controllers' secure environments, and to support federated cohort discovery queries and meta-analysis. This work involves the creation of a system for data standardization and interoperability, which aligns with the first category of "Open community data standards". However, it also involves the development of a new tool or system, which could potentially fall under the third category of "Open source development". Given that the primary focus of the paper is on the development and implementation of a system for data standardization and interoperability, the most appropriate category would be "Open community data standards".

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
