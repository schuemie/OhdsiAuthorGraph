Discussion: This publication is a retrospective study that uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) to examine the sociodemographic characteristics and clinical features of late-life depression (LLD) patients. The study focuses on the analysis of patient data, including age, sex, number of visits, use of drugs, and comorbid conditions. It also investigates the cost of each visit and the utilization rate of certain drugs. The study does not seem to involve the development of new methodologies, software tools, or data standards. Instead, it uses existing tools and standards to generate clinical evidence. Therefore, the publication falls under the category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
