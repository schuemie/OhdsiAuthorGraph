Discussion: This publication is a study that investigates the association between the use of Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) or all-cause dementia. The study uses a Common Data Model (CDM) and performs a distributed network analysis on six observational Korean databases. The study is not focused on maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment, so it does not fit into the first category. It does not focus on developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics, epidemiology, and informatics, so it does not fit into the second category. It also does not focus on creating software tools that codify best practices and enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes, so it does not fit into the third category. The study is focused on conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, estimating effects of medical interventions for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness, and predicting outcomes for disease interception and precision medicine, so it fits into the fourth category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
