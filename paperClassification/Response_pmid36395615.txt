Discussion: The publication discusses the development of an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process for transforming German patient data from FHIR to OMOP CDM. This process is designed to facilitate data harmonization and enable German university hospitals to participate in international observational studies. The work involves the use of OHDSI's OMOP common data model and standardized vocabularies, as well as the Data Quality Dashboard for checking the quality of the transformed data. Therefore, the publication could potentially fall under the "Open community data standards" category. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development of a specific software tool (the ETL process), which is more aligned with the "Open source development" category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
