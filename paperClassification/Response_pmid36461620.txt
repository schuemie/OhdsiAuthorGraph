Discussion: The publication discusses the DaVINCI data-sharing initiative that uses the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to standardize health care codes from the DoD and VA. The paper also presents a methodology for categorizing beneficiaries and creating continuous longitudinal patient records. This involves the use of standardized vocabularies and conventions for data transformation and quality assessment, which aligns with the first category of open community data standards. However, the paper does not seem to focus on methodological research, open-source development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
