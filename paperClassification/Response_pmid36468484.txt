Discussion: The publication discusses a retrospective cohort study that investigates the association of periodontitis with menopause and hormone replacement therapy. The study uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) to analyze patient data. The focus of the study is on generating clinical evidence through the analysis of patient data to test a clinical hypothesis. Although the study uses the OMOP CDM, which is related to open community data standards, the main focus is not on the data standards themselves but on the clinical evidence generated using these standards. Therefore, the publication does not primarily fall under the category of open community data standards.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
