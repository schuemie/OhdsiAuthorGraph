Discussion: This publication focuses on externally validating existing dementia prediction models using observational health data. It involves assessing the transportability and performance of these models across multiple databases and emphasizes the importance of proper reporting for external validation. The study also highlights methodological challenges in prediction model validation, such as incomplete reporting of predictor definitions and coefficients. While the study generates clinical evidence about the performance of dementia prediction models, its primary focus is on evaluating and improving methodological practices for external validation, which aligns with the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches in statistics and epidemiology.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
