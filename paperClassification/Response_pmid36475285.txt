Discussion: This publication investigates the association between NSAID use and the risk of comorbidities and adverse events, with a focus on whether osteoarthritis modifies these associations. The study uses register data and statistical modeling to analyze outcomes, which aligns with generating clinical evidence about disease natural history, treatment utilization, and the effects of medical interventions. The focus is on understanding the real-world impact of NSAID use in patients with and without osteoarthritis, which is directly related to clinical evidence generation. While the study employs statistical methods, its primary goal is not to develop or evaluate new methodologies, nor does it focus on data standards or open-source software development.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
