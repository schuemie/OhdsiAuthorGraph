Discussion: The publication discusses the establishment of an international evidence sharing network for cardiovascular research using the OHDSI research network. It mentions the standardization of data structure and semantics, which is related to the first category of open community data standards. It also discusses the use of a common data model and distributed research networks, which could be seen as part of open source development. However, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the use of this network for conducting network studies in the cardiovascular field, which falls under the fourth category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
