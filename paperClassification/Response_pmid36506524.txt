Discussion: The publication appears to be related to the use of routinely collected healthcare data for vaccine safety surveillance. This suggests an empirical evaluation of epidemiological designs, which falls under the methodological research category. It does not seem to directly involve the development or maintenance of data standards, software tools, or the conduction of network studies to test clinical hypotheses.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
