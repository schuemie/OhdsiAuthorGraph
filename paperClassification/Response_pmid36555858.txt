Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a new predictor, iADRGSE, for identifying adverse drug reactions at the early stage of drug discovery. This involves the use of a "multi-level feature-fusion deep-learning model" that integrates a self-attentive module and a graph-network module. The model is tested and compared with other approaches using the OMOP dataset. This work involves the use of data standards (OMOP) and the development of a new methodological approach, which falls under methodological research. However, it also involves the creation of a new tool (iADRGSE), which could be seen as open source development. Despite the overlap, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of the new methodological approach, which makes it primarily a methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
