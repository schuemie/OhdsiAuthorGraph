Discussion: The publication presents a method for modeling post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC, or long COVID) phenotype data based on electronic healthcare records (EHRs) and for assessing pairwise phenotypic similarity between patients using semantic similarity. This method involves the use of unsupervised machine learning for clustering patients based on their similarity. The study also explores the generalizability of these clusters across different hospital systems. This work involves the use of data standards and methodologies for analyzing EHR data, as well as the generation of clinical evidence about long COVID. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of a new method for analyzing EHR data, which falls under the category of methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
