Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) for process mining in healthcare. It presents a method to extract, construct, and analyze event logs from the OMOP CDM for different process types. The paper also demonstrates the use of CDM-based healthcare process mining with several real-life study cases. This work falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM, a standardized vocabulary, to facilitate collaborative observational research. However, it also touches on "Methodological research" as it develops and evaluates a new approach to process mining using the OMOP CDM. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the use and potential of the OMOP CDM, making "Open community data standards" the most appropriate category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
