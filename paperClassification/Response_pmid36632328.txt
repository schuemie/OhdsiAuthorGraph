Discussion: The publication discusses the application of the OMOP common data model (CDM) to support real-world evaluation of medical devices. It involves the integration of data from different healthcare systems and the implementation of data quality assurance analyses to validate the data extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) process. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of "Open community data standards". However, the study also involves the generation of clinical evidence to support FDA regulatory submissions, which could place it under the "Clinical evidence generation" category. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the use of the OMOP CDM and ETL processes, rather than the generation of clinical evidence itself.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
