Discussion: This publication focuses on developing and evaluating a methodological approach to improve safety surveillance in observational healthcare data. Specifically, it combines empirical calibration with MaxSPRT to address systematic error and sequential testing in post-approval safety surveillance. The emphasis is on statistical methods and their empirical evaluation, which aligns with the goal of determining scientific best practices in statistics and epidemiology. While the study uses real-world data and generates evidence related to safety surveillance, the primary focus is on the methodology itself rather than the clinical evidence generated. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this publication is **Methodological research**.

Final category: 2
