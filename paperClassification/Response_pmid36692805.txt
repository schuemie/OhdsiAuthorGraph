Discussion: The publication is a network cohort study that investigates the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization in patients with osteoarthritis or back pain treated with ibuprofen compared to other NSAIDs or Paracetamol. The study uses large-scale propensity score matching and empirical calibration to minimize confounding and estimates incidence and hazard ratios of COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization according to drug use. The study uses data from two US claims databases mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. This suggests that the study falls under the category of clinical evidence generation as it conducts a network study to test a clinical hypothesis and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
