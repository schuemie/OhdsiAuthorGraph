Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing multinational trends in antipsychotic drug prescribing for people living with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses electronic health records and claims data from multiple countries to examine changes in prescribing rates and the impact of pandemic-related restrictions. The primary goal is to characterize treatment utilization and assess the effects of the pandemic on care quality for people with dementia. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study involves conducting a network study to produce evidence about treatment utilization and its implications.

While the study uses standardized methods and data models (potentially related to **Open community data standards**) and employs statistical techniques (potentially related to **Methodological research**), the primary focus is on generating clinical evidence about prescribing trends and their implications during the pandemic. Therefore, the most appropriate category is **Clinical evidence generation**.

Final category: 4
