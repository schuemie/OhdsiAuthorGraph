Discussion: The publication discusses an approach to identify and increase the structuredness of drug data while ensuring standardization according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification. This involves the development and validation of algorithms to translate unstructured data into ATC codes. This falls under the scope of creating and maintaining data standards, which is a key aspect of the "Open community data standards" category. However, it also involves the development and validation of algorithms, which could be seen as a form of methodological research. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper seems to be on improving the structuredness and standardization of drug data, which is more closely aligned with the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
