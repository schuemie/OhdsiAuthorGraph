Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of phenotype algorithms for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using empirical evidence from observational databases. The authors used OHDSI open-source tools to refine and validate the algorithms, which suggests that the work involves open source development. However, the main focus of the paper is on the methodological research involved in developing and validating these algorithms for use in epidemiological studies. The algorithms were developed using a data-driven approach and validated, providing researchers with confidence in their accuracy. This falls under the category of methodological research as it involves developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
