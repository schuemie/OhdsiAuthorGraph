Discussion: This publication focuses on assessing reproducibility in observational studies by examining variability in cohort definitions across multiple research teams. The study highlights the importance of clear reporting, standardized methodologies, and the use of shared analytical code to ensure reproducibility. The emphasis on evaluating how different interpretations of study logic impact outcomes aligns with methodological research, as it seeks to empirically evaluate best practices in study design and execution. While the study mentions the use of open-source tools and a common data model, the primary focus is on understanding variability and improving methodological rigor, rather than developing software or generating clinical evidence.
