Discussion: The publication discusses a methodology for standardizing clinical data from different organizations into a consistent format for research purposes. This involves the use of ontologies to map locally defined variables to health information standards and common data models, specifically the OMOP CDM. The process includes defining relevant clinical variables, identifying data sources, carrying out an extract-transform-load process, and creating ontologies that map to the OMOP CDM. The methodology is then validated by importing data into the ontologies. This falls under the first category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also touches on the third category of creating software tools that enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes, as the methodology involves the use of a locally developed Protégé plugin. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the standardization of data, which is more aligned with the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
