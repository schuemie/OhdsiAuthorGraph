Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the impact of COVID-19 certification mandates on the incidence of cases and hospitalizations in the UK. The study employs statistical methods such as Difference-in-Differences models, Negative Binomial Segmented Regression, and ARIMA analyses to assess the effects of these mandates. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about the effectiveness of public health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence characterizing the impact of interventions on disease outcomes. While the study uses methodological approaches, its primary focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies, nor does it involve open community data standards or open-source software development.
