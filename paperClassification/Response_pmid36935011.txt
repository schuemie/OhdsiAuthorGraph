Discussion: The publication discusses the development of methods and tools to promote the use of textual data and natural language processing (NLP) in real-world observational studies. It also describes a framework for representing and utilizing textual data in real-world evidence generation, including representations of information from clinical text in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). The workflow and tools that were developed to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from clinical notes into tables in OMOP CDM are also discussed. This suggests that the publication could fall under the categories of "Open community data standards" and "Open source development". However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and application of methods and tools for handling clinical textual data, which aligns more closely with the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
