Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing prescribing trends for fluoroquinolone-containing medicinal products following regulatory interventions by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The study uses electronic health care records from multiple countries to conduct a retrospective cohort analysis, employing statistical methods like segmented regression to detect changes in prescribing rates. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about the impact of regulatory actions on prescribing behavior, which aligns with the OHDSI collaboration category of **Clinical evidence generation**. While the study employs methodological approaches, its primary focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies but rather on producing evidence related to drug utilization and regulatory impact.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
