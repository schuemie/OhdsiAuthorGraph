Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a distributed research network (DRN) for multicenter cancer research, called the cancer research line (CAREL). The DRN is based on a common data model (CDM) and is designed to be easily installed and used by any institution. The authors also discuss the use of JavaScript object notation (JSON) to interface with third-party security solutions such as blockchain. This work involves the creation of a software tool that enables the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes, which aligns with the "Open source development" category. However, the use of a common data model (CDM) and the creation of a data catalog also aligns with the "Open community data standards" category. 

Final category: 3. Open source development
