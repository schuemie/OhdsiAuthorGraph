Discussion: The publication discusses a standardized framework for assessing treatment effect heterogeneity in observational healthcare databases. This involves the development of a prediction model for the outcomes of interest and the estimation of relative and absolute treatment effects within strata of predicted risk. The authors also provide a publicly available R software package for applying this framework to any database mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. This suggests that the publication could fall under the categories of methodological research and open source development. However, the primary focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of a new analytic approach, which aligns more closely with methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
