Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a Common Data Model (CDM) for a federated learning platform in healthcare, specifically for rare diseases. It involves the selection and implementation of a data model that can handle multiple data modalities for predictive modeling. The paper also reviews and evaluates three widely-used approaches (FHIR, OMOP, and Phenopackets) based on a checklist of requirements and specifications. This work falls under the category of open community data standards as it involves the maintenance and development of data models and standards for healthcare data. However, it also touches on aspects of methodological research as it involves the evaluation of different approaches. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development and implementation of a data model, which is more aligned with open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
