Discussion: The publication discusses the use of open-source tools for data harmonization, data quality assessments, and de-identification procedures to generate real-world data from electronic health records. This process is used to provide clinicians and researchers with access to case reports of challenging clinical cases and repurposed treatments. This work involves the use of data standards and the development of software tools, which suggests it could fall under the categories of "Open community data standards" and "Open source development". However, the main focus of the paper is on the use of these tools to generate real-world evidence in critical care, which aligns more closely with the "Clinical evidence generation" category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
