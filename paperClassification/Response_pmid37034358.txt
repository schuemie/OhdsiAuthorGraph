Discussion: The publication discusses a multinational retrospective cohort study aimed at characterizing the incidence rates of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) following SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients and comparing these to historical rates in the general population. The study uses data from primary care, electronic health records, and insurance claims mapped to a common data model. This suggests that the study involves the use of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the study is on generating clinical evidence about the incidence rates of AESIs following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the publication is primarily about clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
