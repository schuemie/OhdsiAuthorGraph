Discussion: The publication discusses the development and testing of an automated system, TAES, that uses artificial intelligence and standard data models to identify patients eligible for specific clinical trials. This involves the use of the OMOP common data model, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of the TAES system, which is a software tool designed to automate the process of identifying eligible patients for clinical trials. This falls under the category of open source development. The paper also touches on methodological research, as it involves the evaluation of the TAES system's performance. However, this is not the main focus of the paper. The paper does not seem to involve clinical evidence generation, as it does not involve conducting network studies or estimating the effects of medical interventions.

Final category: 3. Open source development
