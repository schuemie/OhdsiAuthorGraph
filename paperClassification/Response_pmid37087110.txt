Discussion: The publication discusses a novel method for resolving encounter heterogeneity in electronic health record (EHR) data. This involves the development of algorithms to refine atomic encounters into cleaner, analyzable longitudinal clinical visits. The work is focused on improving the interpretability and usability of clinical encounter data for analysis, particularly when data from multiple sites are networked together. This falls under the development and evaluation of analytic approaches, which is part of methodological research. However, it also involves the use of a common data model, which is related to open community data standards. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development of a new method, rather than on the data standards themselves.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
