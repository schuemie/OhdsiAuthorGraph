Discussion: The publication discusses the feasibility of linking Area Deprivation Index (ADI) scores to observational data in the OMOP Common Data Model. This involves transforming patient-level EHR datasets into the OMOP CDM and linking them with ADI scores using address information. This process is related to maintaining the OMOP common data model and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, it also involves the creation of an analysis package, which could be seen as a form of open source development. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the feasibility of linking ADI scores to the OMOP CDM, which is more closely related to the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
