Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of a standardized ECG database using computerized diagnoses. The database was standardized using Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-common data model (OMOP-CDM). This falls under the category of Open community data standards as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model and OHDSI standardized vocabularies. However, the publication also touches on the use of this database for cardiovascular disease research using big data and artificial intelligence, which could be seen as Clinical evidence generation. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the creation and standardization of the database, which is more aligned with Open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
