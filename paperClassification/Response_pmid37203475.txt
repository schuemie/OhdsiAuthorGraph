Discussion: This publication discusses the use of real-world data (RWD) in research and the challenges of data harmonization across countries. It specifically focuses on the assignment of RxNorm ingredients for medication orders that include only ATC codes. The authors analyze a large number of medication orders and merge them with the ATC vocabulary in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP), including relevant relationship mappings to RxNorm. They also provide a visualization to help research teams understand problematic data and investigate identified issues. This work involves the use of standardized vocabularies and data quality assessment, which are aspects of open community data standards. However, it also involves a degree of methodological research as the authors are investigating a specific issue related to data harmonization and standardization.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
