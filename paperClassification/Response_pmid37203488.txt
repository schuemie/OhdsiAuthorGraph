Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a technical solution for modeling patient treatment trajectories using Markov chains for cost analysis. This involves the use of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. The work seems to be a combination of methodological research and open source development. It involves methodological research as it introduces a new approach to model treatment paths and conduct financial analysis. It also involves open source development as it uses the open source OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model. However, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the development and application of a new method for modeling patient treatment trajectories, which falls under methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
