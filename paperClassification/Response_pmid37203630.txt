Discussion: The publication discusses the DELPHI library, which is a centralized location for depositing, exploring, and analyzing patient-level prediction models. These models are compatible with data mapped to the observational medical outcomes partnership common data model. This suggests that the publication could fall under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of a common data model. However, the focus on creating a tool for model validation, transparency, and dissemination also suggests that it could fall under "Open source development". The tool is designed to enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes. There is no clear focus on methodological research or clinical evidence generation in the abstract.

Final category: 3. Open source development
