Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of a data quality assessment system based on the OMOP CDM v5.3.1, which is a common data model used for healthcare research. The system includes advanced evaluation rules and was used to verify the data quality of six hospitals. The authors also proposed a plan for high-quality data generation and the evaluation of multi-center CDM quality. This work is related to maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment, which falls under the category of open community data standards. It does not seem to involve methodological research, open source development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
