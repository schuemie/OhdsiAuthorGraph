Discussion: The publication discusses the development of OMOP2OBO, an algorithm for mapping Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) vocabularies to Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) ontologies. This work is aimed at standardizing electronic health record (EHR) data and integrating heterogeneous data, which aligns with the first category of open community data standards. However, the development of the algorithm could also be seen as a form of open source development. Despite this, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the standardization and integration of data, rather than the development of the algorithm itself.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
