Discussion: The publication discusses the development and release of SEnDAE, an open-source resource for ingesting environmental variables and measurements from various sources and associating them with arbitrary addresses. This tool is designed to aid in the research of Social and Environmental Determinants of Health (SEDoH). The paper also discusses the extension of the OMOP CDM and the ontology of an i2b2 instance to display and compute over the SEnDAE variables within i2b2. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of open source development as it discusses the creation of a software tool that aids in research. However, it also touches on open community data standards as it discusses the extension of the OMOP CDM. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development of the SEnDAE tool, making open source development the most appropriate category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
