Discussion: The publication discusses the FAIRness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) of databases on the EHDEN portal, which uses the OMOP Common Data Model developed by OHDSI. The focus is on assessing the adherence of these databases to the FAIR principles, which is crucial for effective data reuse in health research. The paper also identifies areas for improvement, such as the lack of globally unique identifiers and metadata standardization. This falls under the first category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. Although it also touches on aspects of open source development, the main focus is on the data standards and their adherence to FAIR principles.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
