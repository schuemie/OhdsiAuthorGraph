Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) for Transformed MSIS Analytic File (TAF) Medicaid records. This involves the translation mapping of TAF concepts to OMOP concepts and the creation of Extract Transform and Load (ETL) code. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. However, the publication also mentions that the CDM can be used to generate evidence for OMOP network studies, which falls under the category of conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the creation and maintenance of the CDM, which makes the first category the most appropriate.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
