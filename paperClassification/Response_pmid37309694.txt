Discussion: This publication presents a retrospective, observational study using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model database to investigate real-world treatment intensity and treatment patterns in patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization. The study does not focus on maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, so it does not fall under the first category. It also does not focus on developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics, epidemiology, and informatics, so it does not fall under the second category. The study does not involve creating software tools that codify best practices and enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes, so it does not fall under the third category. The study does involve conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, estimating effects of medical interventions for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness, and predicting outcomes for disease interception and precision medicine, so it falls under the fourth category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
