Discussion: The publication discusses the development of the ricu R-package, a tool that enables users to analyze publicly available ICU datasets simultaneously. The tool maps each database to a set of clinically relevant concepts, which are grounded in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Vocabulary. This work involves data standardization, including synchronization in the units of measurement and data type representation. The tool also allows users to download, set up, and load data from all of the 5 databases, through a unified Application Programming Interface. This work falls under the category of open source development as it involves creating a software tool that enables consistent and reproducible processes. However, it also touches on open community data standards as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model and OHDSI standardized vocabularies. Despite this, the main focus of the work is on the development of the software tool, making open source development the most appropriate category.

Final category: Open source development
