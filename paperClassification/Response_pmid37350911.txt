Discussion: This publication discusses the development of machine learning models to predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using real-world electronic health records. The study also identifies clinical factors that are most predictive of MCI and develops a data-driven list of clinical procedures commonly ordered in the workup of MCI cases. This work involves the use of the OMOP data model, which suggests a connection to open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of predictive models, which is more closely related to methodological research. The paper also generates clinical evidence related to MCI, but this seems secondary to the methodological focus.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
