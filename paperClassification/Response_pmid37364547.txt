Discussion: The publication discusses a study conducted on two large cohorts of patients with Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD) from the USA and Korea. The study investigates the effect on survival of certain drugs in patients with ALD over a 20-year period. The data for the study was obtained through the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics consortium. The study fills a gap in long-term, real-world data on patients with ALD, confirming the impact of certain drugs on ALD patient's survival. This study is not focused on data standards, methodological research, or software development, but rather on generating clinical evidence through network studies. Therefore, the publication falls under the category of Clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
