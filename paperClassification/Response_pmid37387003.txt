Discussion: This publication discusses the use of Real-World Data (RWD) to identify potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) and the creation of a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for ADR prevention during ePrescription. The project uses the OMOP-CDM data model, which falls under the category of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the paper is on the application of this data model to generate clinical evidence for ADR prevention, which aligns with the category of clinical evidence generation. The paper does not seem to focus on methodological research or open source development.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
