Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a standardized process to integrate openEHR records into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). This involves the creation of the OMOP Conversion Language (OMOCL) and the Eos tool, which are used to automate the Extract Transform and Load (ETL) process from real-world and sample EHRs into the OMOP CDM. This falls under the category of creating tools and processes to standardize and improve data quality, which is a key aspect of open community data standards. However, it also involves the development of new methodologies for data transformation and integration, which could be seen as methodological research. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the development and implementation of tools and processes for data standardization, which is more closely aligned with the open community data standards category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
