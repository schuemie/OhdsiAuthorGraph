Discussion: This publication focuses on the use of unstructured text data from Dutch general practitioner notes in predictive modeling, specifically for clinical prediction tasks. The study involves training and validating prediction models using various text representations and algorithms, and it evaluates the added value of combining structured and unstructured data. The emphasis is on improving predictive performance and exploring the potential of natural language processing (NLP) in clinical settings. While the study involves methodological aspects, such as evaluating different text representations and algorithms, its primary goal is to generate clinical evidence by developing and validating prediction models for specific clinical tasks. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the work aims to produce evidence that can enhance patient care through improved prediction models.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
