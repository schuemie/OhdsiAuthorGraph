Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of the Vein-to-Vein (V2V) database, which is based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. This database is designed to facilitate studies in transfusion medicine by linking information from blood donors, blood components, and patients. The database is comprehensive and includes a diverse set of data from various encounters. The publication also mentions that the final de-identified database will be publicly available. This suggests that the publication is primarily concerned with the creation and maintenance of a common data model, which aligns with the first category of "Open community data standards". However, the database is also intended to facilitate observational studies, which could potentially fall under the fourth category of "Clinical evidence generation". Despite this, the main focus of the publication seems to be on the creation of the database itself, rather than the studies it will facilitate.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
