Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of a novel algorithm, Fed-Padé, for evidence synthesis in distributed research networks with rare outcomes. The algorithm is designed to be efficient, stable, and easy to implement, particularly for models with rare outcomes. The authors have conducted extensive simulation studies and real data analysis to validate the performance of the algorithm. This work falls under the development of new methodologies and the empirical evaluation of these approaches, which is characteristic of methodological research. It does not directly involve the maintenance of data standards, the creation of software tools, or the conduction of network studies to test clinical hypotheses.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
