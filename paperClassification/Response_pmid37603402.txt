Discussion: This publication presents a retrospective, observational cohort study that uses electronic data from the enterprise data warehouse of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and its affiliates, with data in the format of the OHDSI OMOP common data model. The study aims to characterize the use of oral antibiotics and isotretinoin for the treatment of acne in different age groups. The study does not focus on maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, so it does not fall under the first category. It does not focus on developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics, epidemiology, and informatics, so it does not fall under the second category. It does not focus on creating software tools that codify best practices and enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes, so it does not fall under the third category. The study does conduct a network study to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, estimating effects of medical interventions for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness, and predicting outcomes for disease interception and precision medicine, so it falls under the fourth category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
