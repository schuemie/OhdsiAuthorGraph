Discussion: The publication is a retrospective study investigating the impact of cardiovascular co-medications on the survival of patients with liver cirrhosis. The study uses a study-specific R package to process data from local databases of partner institutions within the OHDSI consortium. The study does not focus on maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, so it does not fall under the first category. It does not focus on developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches, so it does not fall under the second category. It does not focus on creating software tools, so it does not fall under the third category. The study does focus on conducting network studies to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, so it falls under the fourth category.
Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
