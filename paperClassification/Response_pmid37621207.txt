Discussion: The publication discusses the development and validation of an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process for the incremental loading of German real-world data based on FHIR and OMOP CDM. This falls under the development of community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. The publication also discusses the efficiency of the developed ETL process, which could be seen as a form of methodological research. However, the main focus of the publication is on the development and validation of the ETL process, which is more aligned with the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
