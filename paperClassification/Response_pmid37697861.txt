Discussion: The publication discusses the design and implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to transfer wound-related data into a standardized common data model, specifically the OMOP Common Data Model. This involves understanding the data, mapping relevant codes to concepts available in OMOP, and implementing the ETL process. The publication also discusses the use of HL7 FHIR CodeSystem and ConceptMap resources for coding and mapping. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
