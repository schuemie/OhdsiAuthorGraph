Discussion: The publication discusses the use of Usagi, an OHDSI annotation tool, to automatically annotate data element names from a Dutch COVID-19 ICU Data Warehouse. The study aims to determine the factors that influence the quality of automatic annotations. This involves the use of a proprietary terminology system and the original hospital labels. The paper also evaluates the performance of Usagi in correctly annotating the data. This falls under the development and evaluation of a tool, which is part of open source development. However, it also involves the standardization of data, which is part of open community data standards. Between the two, the focus is more on the tool (Usagi) and its performance, which makes it lean more towards open source development.

Final category: 3. Open source development
