Discussion: The publication discusses the development and verification of the MetaLAB-HOI algorithm for detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs) using electronic health record (EHR) data. This involves the use of a common model-based multicenter EHR data and a template for clinical health outcomes of interest. The study also involves the calculation of odds ratios for various drugs in different medical centers. This work seems to be a combination of methodological research, as it involves the development and testing of a new algorithm, and clinical evidence generation, as it uses real-world data to detect ADRs and generate clinical evidence. However, the primary focus of the paper is on the development and validation of the MetaLAB-HOI algorithm, which suggests that it falls more squarely into the category of methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
