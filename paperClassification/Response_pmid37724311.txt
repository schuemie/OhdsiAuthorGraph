Discussion: The publication discusses the transformation of the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) from Catalonia, Spain, to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). This process involves the use of open community data standards to ensure the data is in a format that can be used for research. The publication also discusses the use of this transformed data to analyze COVID-19-related outcomes, which falls under the category of clinical evidence generation. However, the main focus of the paper is on the transformation of the data to the OMOP CDM, which is a process that falls under the category of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
