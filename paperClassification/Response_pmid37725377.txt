Discussion: This publication focuses on a network cohort study examining the association between ranitidine use and cancer risk. It involves the use of multiple international databases mapped to the OMOP common data model, large-scale propensity score matching, empirical calibration, and meta-analysis to generate clinical evidence. The study's primary goal is to produce evidence about the safety of ranitidine compared to other H2RAs, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation. While the study leverages standardized data and methodological approaches, its primary focus is on generating evidence to address a clinical question rather than advancing data standards, methodological research, or software development.

Final category: **4. Clinical evidence generation**
