Discussion: This publication discusses the development of a systematic framework to assess patients with Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) using data from electronic health records (EHRs). The study uses natural language processing (NLP) to generate an Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model database. The performance of the NLP model is then assessed. The study also identifies predictive factors related to ATTR-CM in a European population. This publication seems to fall under the categories of methodological research and clinical evidence generation. It involves methodological research as it develops and evaluates an NLP model for data extraction from EHRs. It also involves clinical evidence generation as it uses the developed model to identify predictive factors for ATTR-CM in a real-world population. However, the primary focus of the study is on the development and evaluation of the NLP model, which makes it more aligned with methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
