Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing clinical data to explore associations between ethnic background and various COVID-19-related outcomes, including testing, hospitalization, mortality, and vaccination uptake. The study uses multistate survival analyses to generate evidence about disparities in COVID-19 outcomes and vaccination rates among different ethnic groups in England. The primary goal is to produce clinical evidence that characterizes disease natural history, treatment utilization, and vaccination patterns, which aligns with the objectives of the **Clinical evidence generation** category. While the study employs statistical methods, its focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies, nor does it involve open source software development or data standards.
