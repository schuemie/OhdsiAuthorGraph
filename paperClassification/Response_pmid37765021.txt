Discussion: The publication discusses a study that investigates the impact of the concomitant use of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) and clopidogrel on the recurrence of stroke and myocardial infarction. The study uses two databases, including the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database and the national sample cohort of the NHIS data base converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model version. The study is focused on generating clinical evidence through the analysis of these databases, testing the hypothesis of the interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel, and producing evidence on the recurrence of stroke and myocardial infarction. Therefore, the publication falls under the category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
