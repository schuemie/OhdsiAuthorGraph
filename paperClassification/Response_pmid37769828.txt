Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of the BlendedICU dataset, which is a harmonized and standardized dataset of international intensive care data. The data was standardized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Format, which falls under the category of Open community data standards. However, the publication also discusses the use of this dataset for generalizability studies of machine learning models and statistical studies of clinical practices, which could fall under the category of Methodological research. The publication does not seem to focus on the development of software tools or the conduction of network studies to test clinical hypotheses, so the categories of Open source development and Clinical evidence generation do not seem to apply.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
