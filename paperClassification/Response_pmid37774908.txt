Discussion: This publication discusses the evaluation of different Common Data Models (CDMs) including the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM for representing non-imaging data in a breast cancer use case. The evaluation criteria include content coverage, simplicity, integration, and implementability. The paper also discusses the use of ontologies and standardized vocabularies in these models. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also touches on methodological research as it evaluates and compares different models. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the evaluation and use of the OMOP CDM, which makes it more aligned with the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
