Discussion: The publication discusses the process of standardizing a common data model and developing a national data infrastructure using national claims data. It also talks about the establishment of an Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) common data model database. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also touches on the creation of a distributed data analysis environment, which could be seen as part of open source development. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the standardization and development of data infrastructure, which is more closely aligned with the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
