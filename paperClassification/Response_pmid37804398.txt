Discussion: This publication focuses on leveraging routinely collected health data from a distributed network to support pharmacovigilance signal validation and prioritization. The study involves descriptive analyses of health data to inform decisions about signals and discusses the feasibility, utility, and impact of these analyses. It also highlights the importance of standardization, adverse event phenotypes, and governance for future development. While the study touches on methodological aspects (e.g., statistical signal detection and analytical code standardization), its primary focus is on generating clinical evidence to support pharmacovigilance processes, which aligns with the goal of producing evidence for safety surveillance and decision-making in clinical contexts.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
