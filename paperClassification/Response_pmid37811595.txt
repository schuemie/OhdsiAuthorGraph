Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a cloud-based digital healthcare system for precision medical hospital information systems (P-HIS). The system was developed using international standardization of P-HIS clinical terms and codes, and it was implemented in South Korea's first tertiary hospital cloud. The system is compatible with the common data model and was used to acquire and build ultrahigh-quality medical data for precision medicine. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the use of standardized vocabularies and data models. However, the publication also discusses the development of a software tool (the cloud-based system), which suggests it could also fall under the category of "Open source development". 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
