Discussion: This publication presents a multinational study on the patterns of second line antihyperglycaemic drug initiation among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study uses data from multiple electronic health record and administrative claims databases in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics network. The focus of the study is on the generation of clinical evidence, specifically the incidence of second line antihyperglycaemic drug use and the relative drug class level uptake across cardiovascular risk groups. The study does not appear to focus on data standards, methodological research, or open source development. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this publication is "Clinical evidence generation".

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
