Discussion: The publication focuses on mapping Hungarian procedure codes (OENO) to SNOMED CT, which is a standardized vocabulary used in the OHDSI community. This work aligns with the goal of harmonizing data across different coding systems to enable international research collaborations. The process described involves creating mappings to standard vocabularies, which is a key aspect of maintaining and expanding the OHDSI standardized vocabularies. The challenges and solutions presented in the study contribute to the broader effort of ensuring consistency and interoperability in real-world data research. While the publication touches on methodological aspects (e.g., challenges in mapping and validation), its primary focus is on the development and application of standardized vocabularies, which falls under the category of open community data standards.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
