Discussion: The publication discusses the implementation of a Computable Biomedical Knowledge Object (CBK) in the Piano Platform based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP). This CBK calculates an inpatient quality indicator using synthetic electronic health record (EHR) data in the open OMOP standard. The publication also discusses how CBKs that operate on OMOP data can be reused across datasets that conform to OMOP, which can accelerate the generation of evidence for targeted quality and safety management. This publication seems to touch on aspects of open community data standards, open source development, and clinical evidence generation. However, the main focus of the publication is on the use of the OMOP common data model to create a tool for calculating in-hospital mortality for patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction, which falls under the category of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
