Discussion: The publication discusses the development of an R package, IncidencePrevalence, which is designed to compute incidence rates and prevalence in data mapped to the OMOP common data model. This falls under the scope of creating software tools that enable the community to execute analyses in a consistent and reproducible manner. The package supports descriptive epidemiological research and allows for reliable estimation of incidence and prevalence from large real-world data sets. Therefore, it seems to align most closely with the category of open source development.

Final category: 3. Open source development
