Discussion: The publication discusses the process of standardizing health data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). It provides an analysis of the transformation process, including the duration of key extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes, and the participation of data partners in network research. The paper also provides guidance for future data partners to standardize to the OMOP CDM and participate in distributed networks. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of "Open community data standards". However, it also touches on the aspect of "Clinical evidence generation" as it discusses the participation of data partners in network research. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the standardization of health data, which is a key aspect of "Open community data standards".

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
