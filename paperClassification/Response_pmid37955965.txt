Discussion: The publication discusses the development and validation of a predictive model for postoperative adverse outcomes in older patients. This model was developed using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership common data model and machine learning algorithms. The study also evaluates the performance of the model. This falls under the scope of methodological research as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of an analytic approach. It also touches on clinical evidence generation as it conducts a network study to produce evidence characterizing postoperative outcomes in older patients. However, the primary focus of the paper is on the development and validation of the predictive model, which is more aligned with methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
