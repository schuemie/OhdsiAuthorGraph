Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a Bayesian surveillance procedure for postmarket safety surveillance of mass vaccination programs. This procedure addresses challenges such as sequential multiple testing and biases induced by residual confounding in observational data. The authors compare this new procedure with the existing maximized sequential probability ratio test (MaxSPRT) in terms of testing errors and estimation accuracy. They also provide the full implementation of their method in the open-source R package EvidenceSynthesis. This publication seems to fall under both the methodological research and open source development categories. It involves methodological research as it develops and evaluates a new analytic approach for safety surveillance. It also involves open source development as it provides an implementation of the method in an open-source R package. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of the new method, rather than on the software implementation.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
