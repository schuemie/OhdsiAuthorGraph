Discussion: The publication discusses a study that uses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) to analyze the association between Alzheimer's dementia (AD) treatment and the development of osteoporosis. The study uses data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, which includes diagnosis, demographics, prescription drug, procedures, medical materials, and healthcare resources. The study aims to generate clinical evidence on the impact of persistent AD treatment on the risk of osteoporosis. Although the study uses the OMOP-CDM, which is related to open community data standards, the main focus of the paper is on generating clinical evidence, not on the data standards themselves.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
