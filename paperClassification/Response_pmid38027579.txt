Discussion: The publication discusses the development and validation of the SickKids Enterprise-wide Data in Azure Repository (SEDAR), a system that transforms electronic health record (EHR) data into different schemas for various user types. The process involves copying Epic Clarity data to a virtual network in Microsoft Azure and developing three sequential schemas. One of these schemas, the SK-OMOP Schema, is designed to facilitate research and machine learning and involves mapping medical elements to standard Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) concepts. This work could fall under the categories of "Open community data standards" and "Open source development". However, the primary focus is on the development of a system for transforming and standardizing EHR data, which aligns more closely with the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
