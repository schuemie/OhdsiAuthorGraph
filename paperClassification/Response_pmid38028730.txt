Discussion: The publication discusses the impact of different phenotype definitions on incidence rates across a global data network. It involves the evaluation of outcomes for 13 adverse events and their overall background rates. The study also examines the effect of different modifications to the computable phenotype on background incidence rates. This work is primarily focused on the methodological aspects of defining and evaluating phenotypes for safety research, which is a key aspect of epidemiological studies. Therefore, it falls under the category of methodological research. It does not primarily focus on data standards, software development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
