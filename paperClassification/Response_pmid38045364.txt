Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP common data model and FHIR standards to create a standards-based ETL pipeline for a population-based chronic disease surveillance distributed data network. This involves the transformation of data from the OMOP model to FHIR, and the use of a REST-based Bulk FHIR $export request to extract FHIR resources to populate a local MENDS database. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. However, it also involves the development of a new method for sharing OMOP data, which could be considered methodological research. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the use of existing standards and conventions to facilitate data exchange, which aligns more closely with the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
