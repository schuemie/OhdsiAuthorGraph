Discussion: This publication focuses on the application and evaluation of deep learning models, specifically attention-based neural networks, for clinical prediction modeling using electronic health records (EHRs). The study rigorously compares these models against traditional methods like logistic regression and XGBoost, assessing their performance in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. The emphasis on evaluating and comparing analytic approaches to determine best practices in predictive modeling aligns closely with the goals of methodological research within the OHDSI community. While the study indirectly contributes to clinical evidence generation by improving prediction models, its primary focus is on the development and empirical evaluation of methodologies for predictive analytics.
