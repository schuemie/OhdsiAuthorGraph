Discussion: The publication discusses the use of OHDSI's ATLAS software in clinical trial recruitment support systems. It focuses on the implementation of inclusion and exclusion criteria in clinical studies using ATLAS. The paper also evaluates the software's technical limitations and interaction with medical classification systems. This falls under the development and evaluation of software tools, which is part of the open source development category. However, it also touches on the methodological research category as it involves the evaluation of the software's capabilities and limitations. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the software tool (ATLAS) and its application in clinical studies, which is more aligned with the open source development category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
