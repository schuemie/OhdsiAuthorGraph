Discussion: This publication presents a study that investigates the changing trends and characteristics of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) using data from seven hospital databases converted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model. The study involves the analysis of patient data, the identification of trends, and the generation of clinical evidence related to PUD. The study does not seem to involve the development of new methodologies, software tools, or data standards. Therefore, the publication does not fit into the categories of open community data standards, methodological research, or open source development. Instead, it aligns with the category of clinical evidence generation as it involves conducting a network study to produce evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
