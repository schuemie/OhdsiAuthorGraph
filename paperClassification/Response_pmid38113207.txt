Discussion: The publication discusses the importance of effective data strategies in a comprehensive cancer center, including data collection, analysis, and sharing. It mentions the use of advanced data analysis techniques like natural language processing (NLP) and the importance of data sharing in a controlled, standardized format like OSIRIS RWD, OMOP and FHIR. The paper also highlights the role of real-world data (RWD) studies in cancer research. While the paper touches on aspects of open community data standards (category 1) and open source development (category 3), it primarily focuses on the application of these strategies in the context of clinical evidence generation (category 4). The main goal of the strategies discussed in the paper is to improve understanding of cancer and enhance patient outcomes, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
