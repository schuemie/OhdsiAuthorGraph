Discussion: The publication discusses the creation and use of the OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies, a common reference ontology that is mandatory for all data sites in the OHDSI network. This ontology system supports data harmonization, which is crucial for large-scale observational research. The publication also mentions the use of the OMOP common data model (CDM) and the process of converting source data to the OMOP CDM based on the OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP CDM, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. Although the publication also mentions the use of the ontology system for various research activities, the main focus is on the development and maintenance of the OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies, which is a data standard.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
