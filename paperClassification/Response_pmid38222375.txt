Discussion: This publication discusses the development of a comprehensive framework for computational phenotyping for prenatal and postpartum episodes based on the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). It involves the use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and the implementation of this framework on a national EHR database. This work is related to the development and application of a method for handling and analyzing data, which aligns with the "Methodological research" category. However, it also involves the use of the OMOP CDM, which is a part of the "Open community data standards". Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development and application of a new method, rather than on the maintenance or development of the data standards themselves.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
