Discussion: The publication discusses the use of standardized operational definitions to improve the reproducibility of research using real-world healthcare data. This involves defining, grouping, and mapping value sets, which are then reviewed and updated based on findings. This process is crucial for maintaining data standards and ensuring that data is consistently interpreted across different studies and healthcare systems. Therefore, the publication falls under the category of "Open community data standards". However, it also touches on the aspect of "Clinical evidence generation" as it discusses the application of these standards in a study evaluating the effectiveness of a COVID-19 prophylaxis. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the process of standardizing operational definitions, which is more related to data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
