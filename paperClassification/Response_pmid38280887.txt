Discussion: The publication discusses the development and comparison of machine learning models for patient-level prediction using the OMOP common data model. It evaluates the performance, execution time, and ease of model implementation of different approaches, including the OHDSI's ATLAS and "Patient-level Prediction" (PLP) tools, and a native R-based solution. This involves elements of methodological research, as it involves the empirical evaluation of analytic approaches. It also involves elements of open source development, as it discusses the development and use of software tools for analysis. However, the main focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of methods for patient-level prediction, which falls under the category of methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
