Discussion: This publication focuses on the integration of real-world evidence (RWE) into health technology assessment (HTA), emphasizing stakeholder collaboration, training, and exemplar research projects to overcome barriers such as data quality concerns and uncertainty about best practices. While the workshop and its findings touch on methodological aspects (e.g., best practices for RWE use) and stakeholder collaboration, the primary focus appears to be on generating clinical evidence to inform healthcare decision-making and improve HTA processes. The emphasis on using RWE to strengthen the evidence base for HTA aligns most closely with the category of **Clinical evidence generation**, as it involves producing evidence to support healthcare decisions and policy-making.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
