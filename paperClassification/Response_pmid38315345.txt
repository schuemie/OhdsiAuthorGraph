Discussion: The publication discusses the development of the Medical Imaging Common Data Model (MI-CDM) extension to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM). This extension is designed to support imaging research by addressing structural and semantic requirements, linking DICOM data sources, and tracking the provenance of imaging features derived from those images. This work is primarily focused on the standardization of data, which is crucial for enabling consistent and reproducible research. Therefore, it aligns with the "Open community data standards" category. Although the work could potentially contribute to methodological research and open-source development, the main focus is on data standardization.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
