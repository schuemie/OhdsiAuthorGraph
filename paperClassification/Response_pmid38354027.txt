Discussion: The publication discusses the use of metadata-driven approaches for data harmonization in the medical domain, specifically focusing on the development of generic Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) or Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) processes. This falls under the scope of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. The paper also mentions the need for further research to evaluate the most appropriate metadata-driven approaches and how to integrate them into the ETL/ELT process, which could be seen as methodological research. However, the primary focus of the paper is on the use of these processes for data harmonization, which is more closely related to the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
