Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by conducting a multi-national cohort study to evaluate the absolute risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The study involves analyzing data from multiple countries to characterize disease outcomes and assess risks associated with COVID-19 over time, including before and during vaccine availability. The primary goal is to produce evidence about disease natural history and treatment utilization, which aligns closely with the objectives of clinical evidence generation. While the study may indirectly rely on standardized data models or methodological approaches, its primary focus is on generating actionable clinical insights rather than developing standards, methods, or software tools.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
