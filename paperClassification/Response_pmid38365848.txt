Discussion: The publication discusses a study protocol for investigating the effectiveness of an IT-supported patient recruitment tool in clinical trials. The tool uses patient data collected in general care for screening according to specific criteria, which are translated into a machine-readable format using the OHDSI ATLAS tool. This falls under the scope of open source development as it involves the creation of a software tool that enables consistent and reproducible processes. However, it also touches on clinical evidence generation as it conducts a study to test the effectiveness of the tool. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the development and application of the tool, rather than the generation of clinical evidence.

Final category: 3. Open source development
