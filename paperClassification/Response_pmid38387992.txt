Discussion: The publication discusses the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM), its governance processes, and how it transforms electronic medical record (EMR) data into a standardized format. It also discusses how the OMOP-CDM simplifies data management processes and governance, promotes interoperability, and supports a wide range of research projects. This falls under the category of maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also touches on the creation of shared end-to-end analysis packages, which could be seen as part of open source development. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the OMOP-CDM and its use in standardizing and managing EMR data, which is more aligned with the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
