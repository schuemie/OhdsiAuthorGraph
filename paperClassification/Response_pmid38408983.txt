Discussion: The publication discusses the conceptualization of a generic data harmonization process for the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). It involves the transformation of local source data into the standardized OMOP CDM format. The process includes steps like dataset specification, data profiling, vocabulary identification, coverage analysis of vocabularies, semantic mapping, structural mapping, extract-transform-load-process, qualitative and quantitative data quality analysis. This falls under the maintenance of the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. Therefore, it aligns with the first category of "Open community data standards". 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
