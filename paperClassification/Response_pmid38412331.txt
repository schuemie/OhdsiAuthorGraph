Discussion: This publication discusses the development and validation of predictive models for post-surgery patient outcomes using electronic health records (EHRs) from four different countries. The models were developed using OHDSI tools and validated on separate patient cohorts. The study introduces a new methodology for evaluating features during both the development phase and the validation, with a focus on improving the generalizability of the models. This falls under the scope of methodological research as it involves the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches. However, it also touches on open community data standards as the EHRs were mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the methodological approach to developing and validating the models, rather than the data standards used.
