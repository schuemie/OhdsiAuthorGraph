Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing real-world treatment trajectories for asthma and COPD using data from multiple claims and electronic health record databases across different countries. The study aims to characterize treatment patterns and visualize them, providing insights into clinical practice and treatment variability. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about disease management and treatment utilization, which aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category. While the study uses standardized methods and tools (potentially developed by OHDSI), its focus is not on methodological research, open source development, or data standards but rather on producing evidence to inform clinical practice.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
