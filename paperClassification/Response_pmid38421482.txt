Discussion: The publication discusses the development of prediction models for short-term mortality risk assessment following colorectal cancer surgery. The data used for this study was harmonized from four Danish observational health databases into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. This suggests that the study involves the use of open community data standards. However, the main focus of the study is on the development and evaluation of prediction models, which falls under the category of methodological research. The study does not seem to involve the creation of software tools, so it does not fall under the category of open source development. While the study does involve the generation of clinical evidence, the primary focus is not on testing clinical hypotheses or producing evidence characterizing disease natural history and treatment utilization, but rather on developing and evaluating prediction models.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
