Discussion: The publication discusses a framework for understanding the growth and impact of an open scientific community, specifically OHDSI, by tracking and evaluating its activities. The paper presents a modern architecture that uses open application programming interfaces to capture publicly available data on open science activities. This includes publications, teaching, and engagement. The paper also discusses the insights provided by this approach and its implications for different users. While the paper touches on aspects of open community data standards and open source development, it does not focus on maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment, nor does it focus on creating software tools. Instead, it focuses on understanding the growth and impact of the OHDSI community, which is more related to methodological research.
