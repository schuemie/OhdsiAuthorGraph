Discussion: The publication discusses the development of two R-packages to facilitate health economics research on OMOP-based data networks. This involves creating software tools to standardize and improve the reproducibility, transparency, and transferability of health economic models. The tools were then used to replicate a UK-based heart failure data analysis across multiple international databases. This falls under the category of open source development as it involves creating software tools that enable the community to execute analyses through consistent and reproducible processes. However, it also touches on methodological research as it involves developing and empirically evaluating analytic approaches. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the development and application of the software tools, making open source development the most appropriate category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
