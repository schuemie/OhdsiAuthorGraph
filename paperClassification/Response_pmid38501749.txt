Discussion: This publication focuses on comparing the safety and effectiveness of two antihypertensive drug classes (ACE inhibitors and thiazides) under strict monotherapy conditions. The study involves generating clinical evidence by analyzing hazard ratios for various outcomes across multiple databases. The primary goal is to test clinical hypotheses and produce evidence about the comparative effectiveness and safety of these medications. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on producing evidence to inform medical decision-making and treatment strategies. While the study may involve methodological considerations (e.g., cohort definitions and sensitivity analyses), the primary focus is on generating clinical evidence rather than developing new methodologies or tools.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
