Discussion: The publication is a study that uses real-world data to investigate the prevalence of constipation and laxative use in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The data used in the study was transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, which suggests that the study could fall under the category of "Open community data standards". However, the main focus of the study is not on the data model itself, but on the clinical evidence generated from the data. The study provides evidence on the prevalence of constipation in CKD patients, the risk of constipation in these patients compared to non-CKD individuals, and the patterns of laxative prescription in these patients. Therefore, the study is best classified under the category of "Clinical evidence generation".

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
