Discussion: The publication is a study that uses real-world data to examine the patterns of comorbidities and the prescribing and dispensing of NSAIDs among patients with osteoarthritis. It uses data from three large administrative claims databases to construct a retrospective cohort of patients with osteoarthritis. The study then identifies the prevalence of NSAID dispensing patterns pre- and post-diagnosis of osteoarthritis. This study is generating clinical evidence based on real-world data, which aligns with the fourth category of OHDSI's collaboration categories. It does not focus on data standards, methodological research, or open-source development.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
