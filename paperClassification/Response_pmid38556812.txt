Discussion: The publication discusses the use of a federated data network (FDN) approach to increase the power of observational research in rare diseases. It emphasizes the importance of a strong governance model for successful collaboration, which includes data privacy, ethical, and legal compliance. The paper also highlights the role of data curation and harmonization, and distributed analytical methods in achieving reproducibility. The use of OHDSI community set of methods and tools in two rare disease-specific FDNs is also discussed. This publication seems to touch on aspects of open community data standards (through the discussion of data harmonization and the use of OHDSI standards), methodological research (through the discussion of the FDN approach and distributed analytical methods), and clinical evidence generation (through the discussion of observational research in rare diseases). However, the main focus of the paper is on the use of a specific approach (FDN) to generate real-world evidence in rare diseases, which aligns most closely with the category of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
