Discussion: The publication discusses the development, implementation, and evaluation of a federated infrastructure to facilitate versatile secondary use of health data. This infrastructure uses an extract-transform-load framework that pseudonymizes and links data with privacy-preserving record linkage and harmonizes into a common data model (OMOP CDM). This falls under the category of Open community data standards as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. However, it also involves the creation of a software tool (Health Data Space nodes) that enables the community to execute analyses, which falls under the category of Open source development. Despite the overlap, the primary focus of the paper seems to be on the development and implementation of the infrastructure, which makes it more aligned with the Open source development category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
