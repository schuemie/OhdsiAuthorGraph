Discussion: The publication discusses the development and evaluation of an open-source application, the "Health Equity Explorer (H2E)," designed to enable users to explore health equity data across common data models (CDMs). This tool is developed to explore a wide variety of drivers of health, including patient-reported Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), using data in an OMOP CDM research data repository. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of open source development as it discusses the creation of a software tool. However, the tool also seems to be used for clinical evidence generation as it is used to explore health equity data and could potentially support distributed health equity research and intervention on a national scale. Despite this, the main focus of the publication is on the development and evaluation of the tool, making open source development the most appropriate category.

Final category: 3. Open source development
