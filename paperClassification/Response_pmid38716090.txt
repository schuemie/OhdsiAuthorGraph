Discussion: This publication focuses on the computational challenges of fitting survival regression models in large-scale observational health databases and proposes a solution using GPU-based parallelization. The work involves developing efficient algorithms for Cox proportional hazards models and Fine-Gray models, which are implemented in the open-source R package Cyclops. The emphasis on creating scalable computational methods and integrating them into an open-source tool aligns with the goals of the OHDSI community. While the paper touches on methodological aspects (e.g., optimization approaches for survival analysis), its primary contribution is the development of software tools that enable efficient execution of large-scale analyses. This aligns most closely with the **Open source development** category, as the focus is on creating and improving software tools for reproducible and scalable analysis.

Final category: 3. Open source development
