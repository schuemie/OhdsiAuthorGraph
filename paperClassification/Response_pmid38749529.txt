Discussion: The publication discusses the development and features of the Taipei Medical University Clinical Research Database (TMUCRD), which is a repository of real-world data derived from electronic health records and other sources. The database was converted to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) for standardization. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of open community data standards as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, and community conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) and data quality assessment. The publication does not seem to involve methodological research, open source development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
