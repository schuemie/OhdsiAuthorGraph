Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating different penalization methods for linear models in the context of healthcare prediction using observational health data. The study involves a methodological comparison of regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2, ElasticNet, etc.) and assesses their performance in terms of discrimination, calibration, and model complexity. The emphasis is on determining the best practices for healthcare prediction modeling, which aligns with the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches in statistics and informatics. This type of research is characteristic of **Methodological research**, as it aims to refine and establish scientific best practices for statistical modeling in observational health data.

While the study uses clinical data and generates predictive models, its primary focus is not on generating clinical evidence or testing clinical hypotheses (which would align with **Clinical evidence generation**). Similarly, the study does not involve the creation of software tools (**Open source development**) or the maintenance of data standards (**Open community data standards**).

Final category: **Methodological research**
