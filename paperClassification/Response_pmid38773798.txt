Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a standardized method to calculate daily drug doses using the OMOP Common Data Model and a single reference table from OHDSI. This involves the creation of formulas based on data from various databases and testing these formulas against the World Health Organization's Defined Daily Dose. The results show that the formulas are applicable to a large proportion of drug records in the assessed databases. This work falls under the category of open community data standards as it involves the use of the OMOP CDM and standardized vocabularies. However, it also involves methodological research as it involves the development and testing of new formulas. Despite this, the primary focus of the work is on the use and enhancement of the OMOP CDM, making it primarily a work of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
