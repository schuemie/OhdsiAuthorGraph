Discussion: The publication discusses the alignment of the OMOP and Phenopackets data models to promote interoperability in precision medicine and translational research. It involves the development of a data transformation process and evaluation method, which is used to map real-world patient data from OMOP to Phenopackets. The study also identifies gaps between the models and provides considerations for transforming data between them. This work falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves maintaining the OMOP common data model and developing community conventions for data transformation and quality assessment. However, it also touches on "Methodological research" as it develops and evaluates a new approach for data transformation. Despite this, the primary focus of the paper is on the alignment and transformation of data models, which is more closely related to the first category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
