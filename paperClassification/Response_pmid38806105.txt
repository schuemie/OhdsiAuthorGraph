Discussion: This publication discusses the use of the OMOP common data model for data harmonization in a multi-cohort dementia research study. It also discusses the challenges and solutions encountered in transforming and standardizing cohort data using the OMOP CDM. The paper also discusses the use of federated learning as a privacy-preserving solution for multi-cohort studies. This publication seems to touch on aspects of open community data standards (category 1) as it discusses the use and limitations of the OMOP CDM for data harmonization. It also touches on aspects of methodological research (category 2) as it discusses the use of federated learning as a method for privacy-preserving data analysis. However, the main focus of the paper seems to be on the use and evaluation of the OMOP CDM for data harmonization, which falls under category 1.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
