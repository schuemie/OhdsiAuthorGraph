Discussion: The publication discusses the use of the OMOP common data model and FHIR standards to create a standards-based ETL pipeline for a population-based chronic disease surveillance distributed data network. This involves the transformation of data from the OMOP model to FHIR, creating FHIR compliant resources, and populating a local MENDS database. The work is focused on maintaining data standards and conventions for ETL processes, which aligns with the first category. However, it also involves the development of a new method for sharing OMOP data, which could be seen as methodological research. Despite this, the primary focus appears to be on the use and maintenance of data standards, making the first category the most appropriate.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
