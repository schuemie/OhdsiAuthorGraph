Discussion: The publication discusses the creation of a set of document templates designed to streamline the data protection and information security-related documentation and coordination efforts required to establish OHDSI installations. This work is related to the implementation and operation of a software stack for real-world evidence generation. While it does touch on the OMOP-CDM, the focus is not on maintaining the data model or vocabularies, but rather on facilitating the use of the software. Therefore, it does not fit into the "Open community data standards" category. It also does not involve methodological research or clinical evidence generation. The work is most closely related to the "Open source development" category, as it involves creating tools (in this case, document templates) to enable the community to execute analyses.

Final category: 3. Open source development
