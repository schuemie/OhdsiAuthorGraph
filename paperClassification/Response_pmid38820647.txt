Discussion:  
This publication focuses on refining unspecific condition codes in Dutch general practitioner EHR data by leveraging clinical text and machine learning techniques. The study evaluates different text classification approaches, including search queries, semi-supervised learning, and supervised learning, to improve the specificity of clinical codes. The work involves methodological innovation in text classification and machine learning, aiming to enhance the quality of observational healthcare data for research and patient care. This aligns with the **methodological research** category, as the study develops and evaluates analytic approaches to improve data specificity and quality, which are critical for observational studies and evidence generation. While the refined codes could ultimately support clinical evidence generation, the primary focus of the publication is on the methodological development and evaluation of text classification techniques.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
