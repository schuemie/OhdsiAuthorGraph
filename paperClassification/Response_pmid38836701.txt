Discussion: The publication discusses the sharing of sensitive data in life sciences, comparing centralized and federated data sharing models. It mentions the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership/OHDSI network as one of the use cases. The paper does not focus on the development of software tools, nor does it conduct network studies to test clinical hypotheses. It does not specifically discuss the OMOP common data model, OHDSI standardized vocabularies, or community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. However, it does touch on the topic of data harmonization and interoperability, which are related to data standards. The main focus of the paper is on the methodological aspect of data sharing, specifically the comparison of different models for sharing sensitive data. Therefore, it can be classified under methodological research.
