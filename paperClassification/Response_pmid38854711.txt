Discussion: This publication discusses the PIONEER project, which aims to evaluate the generalizability of randomized controlled trial (RCT) findings concerning newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer. The study will use observational health data, primarily sourced from population-based registries, electronic health records, and insurance claims data, which are mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. This suggests that the publication could fall under the "Open community data standards" category. However, the main focus of the study is to generate clinical evidence by comparing the characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer enrolled in RCTs and those in real-world settings. This indicates that the publication is more aligned with the "Clinical evidence generation" category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
