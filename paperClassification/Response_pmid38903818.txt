Discussion: The publication discusses the development of a Service Platform Prototype that facilitates the provision of harmonized real-world data for cross-site research. This involves the creation of standardized methods and tools, including a common core dataset, and the use of the OMOP common data model. The publication also discusses the implementation of additional services to facilitate data utilization, exchange, and analysis. This suggests that the publication falls under the category of "Open community data standards" as it involves the maintenance of the OMOP common data model and the development of community conventions for data exchange and quality assessment. However, the publication also involves the creation of software tools, which suggests that it could also fall under the category of "Open source development". 

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
