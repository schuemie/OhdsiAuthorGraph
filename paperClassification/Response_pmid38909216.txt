Discussion: The publication discusses a method for generating synthetic patient data from real patient records in a privacy-preserving and compliant manner. It uses the OMOP data standard for electronic health records and Synthea for data synthetization. The study involves the development of data pipelines, the application of statistical algorithms, and the evaluation of the resulting graphs. This work involves elements of open community data standards (as it uses the OMOP data model), methodological research (as it applies and evaluates statistical algorithms), and open source development (as it involves the creation of data pipelines). However, the primary focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of a method for generating synthetic data, which falls under the category of methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
