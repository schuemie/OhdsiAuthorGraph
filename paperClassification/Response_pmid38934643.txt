Discussion: This publication focuses on validating Dutch clinical concept extraction tools using annotated corpora translated from English. It involves methodological innovation in preserving annotations during machine translation and assessing the performance of concept extraction tools across languages. The study emphasizes the development and evaluation of techniques for creating multilingual corpora and validating tools, which aligns with methodological research aimed at advancing best practices in informatics and natural language processing. While the study indirectly supports clinical evidence generation by enabling better concept extraction tools, its primary focus is on the methodology for translation and validation.
