Discussion: The publication discusses a novel method to transform the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Models (OMOP CDM) into Object-Centric Event Logs (OCELs). This transformation is aimed at enhancing the analysis of healthcare processes. The study involves the creation of an OMOP CDM4PM from the standard OMOP CDM, focusing on data relevant to generating OCEL and addressing healthcare data's heterogeneity and standardization challenges. This process involves the development of a new method, testing it on a database, and evaluating its effectiveness. The publication seems to be a blend of open community data standards and methodological research. However, the primary focus is on the development and evaluation of a new method for transforming OMOP CDM into OCELs, which falls under methodological research.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
