Discussion: This publication discusses the development of a model for predicting individual-level risk scores for adverse drug events related to multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapy. The model uses observational medical outcomes partnership common data model (OMOP CDM) concepts derived from an electronic health record as model features. The authors also implemented a novel extension of the local interpretable model agnostic explanation (LIME) method, knowledge graph LIME (KG-LIME) to leverage the KG and explain individual predictions of each model. This falls under the development and evaluation of analytic approaches, which is part of methodological research. However, the study also involves the generation of clinical evidence through the testing of the model on a set of patients and the prediction of adverse events, which falls under clinical evidence generation. While the study involves elements of both categories, the main focus is on the development and evaluation of the model, which is a methodological research activity.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
