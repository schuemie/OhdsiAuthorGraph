Discussion: The publication discusses the integration of medical imaging data with the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to improve multimodal research. It introduces a new method for combining these data types and validates the approach using actual data from patients with lung cancer. The study also introduces new tables to standardize various imaging-related data and link to clinical data. This work is primarily focused on the development and application of data standards, specifically for the integration of medical imaging data with the OMOP CDM. Therefore, it aligns with the "Open community data standards" category. However, it also touches on the "Clinical evidence generation" category as it uses actual patient data to validate the approach and discusses its potential to enhance diagnostics and treatment strategies. Despite this, the main focus of the paper is on the development and application of data standards, making this the most appropriate category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
