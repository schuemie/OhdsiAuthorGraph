Discussion: The publication describes the development of an R package, "allofus," designed to facilitate the use of the All of Us Research Program data, which is transformed into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The focus is on creating software tools that address challenges in working with survey and electronic health record data, enabling researchers to conduct complex analyses with improved efficiency, reproducibility, and transparency. This aligns closely with the **Open source development** category, as the article emphasizes the creation of a software tool to support research using OMOP CDM data. While the publication mentions the OMOP CDM and its relevance to network studies, the primary contribution is the development of the R package itself, rather than generating clinical evidence or advancing methodological research.

Final category: 3. Open source development
