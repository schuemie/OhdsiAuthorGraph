Discussion: This publication primarily focuses on the integration and standardization of hearing health data into the OMOP common data model, demonstrating the process of "OMOPification" and the development of a data architecture for linking electronic patient record systems to research systems. The emphasis is on curating and standardizing data for research purposes, which aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and applying open community data standards. While the study also touches on the potential for clinical evidence generation by identifying priority research areas, the core contribution of the publication is the establishment of a standardized data resource and the integration of hearing health data into the OMOP common data model. This aligns most strongly with the category of **Open community data standards**, as it focuses on the standardization and harmonization of data for broader use in research.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
