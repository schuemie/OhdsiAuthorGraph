Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and validation of a patient-level prediction model for dementia using observational databases. The study involves assessing regularization methods, selecting predictors, and externally validating the model across multiple databases. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence by predicting dementia risk, which aligns with the broader aim of clinical evidence generation in the OHDSI community. While the study incorporates methodological aspects, such as evaluating regularization techniques (L1 and BAR), the emphasis is on applying these methods to produce actionable clinical insights. Therefore, the publication is best categorized under **Clinical evidence generation**, as it aims to predict outcomes for disease interception and precision medicine.
