Discussion: This publication focuses on enhancing the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles for population health data through the development and implementation of a framework that integrates metadata standards, including the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The study emphasizes the use of standardized formats, vocabularies, and protocols to improve machine-readability and interoperability of metadata, which aligns with the goals of maintaining and advancing open community data standards. The framework leverages the OMOP CDM for harmonization and standardization, which is a core aspect of OHDSI's open community data standards category. While the study also involves technical implementation (e.g., JSON-LD and Schema.org integration), the primary focus is on the standardization and accessibility of metadata, rather than software development or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
