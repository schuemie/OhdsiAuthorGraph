Discussion: This publication primarily focuses on the transformation of primary care data into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), including structural and semantic mapping, validation, and the development of a dashboard for usability. The study emphasizes the process of standardizing electronic health record data using the OMOP CDM and mapping local vocabularies to OHDSI standardized vocabularies. This aligns closely with the goals of the **Open community data standards** category, which involves maintaining the OMOP CDM, standardized vocabularies, and conventions for extract-transform-load (ETL) processes and data quality assessment. While the development of a dashboard could suggest some overlap with **Open source development**, the primary focus of the publication is on the transformation and standardization of data, which is central to the **Open community data standards** category.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
