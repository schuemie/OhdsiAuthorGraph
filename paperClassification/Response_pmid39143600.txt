Discussion: This publication focuses on customizing the OMOP common data model (CDM) for rare diseases, including the development of a rare diseases-specific CDM (RD-CDM), the creation of ETL processes, and ensuring interoperability with the OMOP CDM. The work emphasizes harmonizing data sources and aligning them with standardized data structures to enable multi-center studies and facilitate the use of OHDSI analytical tools. This aligns closely with the goals of the **Open community data standards** category, as it involves maintaining and extending the OMOP CDM and ensuring data quality and interoperability. While the publication mentions the potential for clinical evidence generation using the customized CDM, the primary focus is on the development and customization of the data model itself, which is foundational to enabling future studies.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
