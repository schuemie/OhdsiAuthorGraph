Discussion: This publication primarily focuses on harmonizing Norwegian health registries onto the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), which involves mapping data, developing an ETL pipeline, and ensuring data quality. The work emphasizes the challenges and opportunities in mapping pregnancy and COVID-19-related data, as well as the creation of custom concepts to accommodate specific terminologies. These activities align closely with the goals of maintaining and applying the OMOP CDM, standardized vocabularies, and conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. While the publication mentions the potential for federated research, the primary focus is on the technical and methodological aspects of data harmonization and mapping, rather than generating clinical evidence or developing new analytic methods.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
