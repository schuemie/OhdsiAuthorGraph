Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing trends in incidence, prevalence, and survival of breast cancer in the United Kingdom over a 21-year period. The study uses population-based cohort data to generate clinical evidence about breast cancer, including differences between sexes, age-related trends, and survival probabilities. The findings aim to characterize disease natural history and treatment outcomes, as well as highlight the impact of screening programs and treatment advancements. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on producing evidence to inform clinical understanding and decision-making.

While the study uses statistical methods (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis) and data from standardized databases, its primary focus is not on developing new methodologies, software tools, or data standards. Instead, it is aimed at generating actionable clinical insights about breast cancer trends and outcomes.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
