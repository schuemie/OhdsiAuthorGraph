Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the extent to which physical therapy assessments are represented in the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and suggests improvements to enhance the inclusion of functional data. The study involves mapping physical therapy assessments to the OMOP CDM and analyzing the coverage and consistency of these mappings. This aligns closely with the category of "Open community data standards," as it pertains to maintaining and improving the OMOP CDM and standardized vocabularies, as well as proposing guidelines for better mapping practices. While the study indirectly supports clinical evidence generation by improving data representation, its primary focus is on the data standards themselves.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
