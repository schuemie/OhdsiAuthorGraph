Discussion: The publication focuses on the generation of synthetic data for hematology research, specifically Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and its standardization into OMOP and FHIR formats. The emphasis on converting synthetic data into the OMOP common data model aligns with the goal of maintaining and expanding open community data standards. The integration into FHIR also suggests interoperability and standardization efforts. While the study indirectly supports clinical evidence generation by enabling broader research opportunities, its primary focus is on standardizing data formats and facilitating integration into research platforms, which is central to the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
