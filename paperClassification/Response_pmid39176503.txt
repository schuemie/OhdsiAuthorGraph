Discussion: The publication focuses on using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to address interoperability issues when integrating climatic and medical data for forecasting resource utilization during acute heat events. This suggests a focus on data standardization and the application of the OMOP CDM to ensure consistent and interoperable data handling. While the study involves forecasting resource utilization, the emphasis on data interoperability and the use of OMOP CDM aligns most closely with the category of "Open community data standards," as it pertains to maintaining and applying the OMOP CDM for data integration.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
