Discussion: The publication focuses on assessing the effectiveness of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) in standardizing data related to Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) in intensive care units. It discusses the process of extracting, transforming, and loading data into the OMOP format, as well as challenges related to data variability and the lack of standard concepts. This aligns closely with the goals of the **Open community data standards** category, which involves maintaining and improving the OMOP CDM, standardized vocabularies, and conventions for ETL and data quality assessment. While the study mentions predictive modeling as a potential application, the primary focus is on data standardization and quality, which is foundational to enabling such downstream analyses.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
