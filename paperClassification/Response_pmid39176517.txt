Discussion: The publication focuses on the development of a visualization dashboard for ICU quality indicators using the OMOP Common Data Model. This suggests a focus on creating a software tool that leverages the OMOP CDM to enable consistent and reproducible visualization of data across hospitals. The emphasis on the dashboard's functionality and its implementation aligns with the goals of open source development within the OHDSI community. While the paper mentions the use of the OMOP CDM, it does not primarily focus on maintaining or advancing the data standards themselves, which would fall under the "Open community data standards" category. Additionally, the paper does not delve into methodological research or clinical evidence generation, as its primary contribution is the creation of a tool for data visualization.

Final category: 3. Open source development
