Discussion: The publication focuses on the development of a platform with a chatbot-like mechanism to enhance the discovery of OMOP CDM databases. This involves creating a tool that leverages metadata from OMOP CDM databases to assist researchers in identifying relevant databases for their studies. The emphasis on developing a software tool aligns closely with the goals of **open source development**, as it involves creating a technological solution to address challenges in data discovery and interoperability within the OHDSI community. While the work indirectly supports clinical evidence generation by facilitating access to relevant databases, the primary focus is on the creation of the platform itself, which is a software development effort.

Final category: 3. Open source development
