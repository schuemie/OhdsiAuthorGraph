Discussion: This publication focuses on enhancing semantic interoperability in the oncology domain by leveraging ontologies, specifically a Hyperontology, to address challenges in integrating heterogeneous cancer image data models. While it mentions OMOP and FHIR data standards, the primary focus is on semantic interoperability rather than the development or maintenance of the OMOP common data model or standardized vocabularies. The study aligns with informatics and methodological research, as it explores an approach to improve data integration and interoperability, which is a foundational aspect of methodological research in the OHDSI community. It does not directly involve clinical evidence generation or open-source software development.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
