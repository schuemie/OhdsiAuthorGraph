Discussion: The publication focuses on mapping the OMOP Common Data Model (OMOP-CDM) to RDF (Resource Description Framework) to enhance semantic interoperability and align real-world data with the principles of the Semantic Web. This effort is aimed at improving the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) qualities of the data and enabling integration with Linked Open Data. The work involves leveraging the OMOP-CDM, which is central to OHDSI's open community data standards, and adapting it to a new format for broader interoperability. While the publication touches on methodological aspects (e.g., semantic enrichment) and open-source development (e.g., creating tools for RDF mapping), its primary focus is on extending the OMOP-CDM to support semantic data interoperability, which aligns most closely with the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
