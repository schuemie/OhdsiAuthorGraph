Discussion: The publication focuses on comparing OntoBridge, an ontology-based tool, with traditional ETL methods for transforming local datasets into CDMs, specifically the OMOP CDM. The emphasis is on enhancing data standardization and improving the efficiency of the ETL process. This aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and improving the OMOP common data model and community conventions for ETL processes, which are central to the **Open community data standards** category. While the article touches on methodological aspects (e.g., comparing approaches) and software development (OntoBridge as a tool), its primary focus is on the process of data standardization and integration into CDMs, making it most relevant to the first category.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
