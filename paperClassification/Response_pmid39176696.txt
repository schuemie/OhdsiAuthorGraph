Discussion: The publication focuses on the development of a FHIR server to facilitate interoperability between the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and FHIR standards, specifically for patient-generated health data (PGHD). This work involves creating software tools and infrastructure to enable data exchange and interaction, which aligns with the goals of open source development within the OHDSI community. While the paper touches on data standards (OMOP-CDM and FHIR), its primary focus is on the technical implementation of a server and the use of APIs, which falls under the category of open source development.

Final category: 3. Open source development
