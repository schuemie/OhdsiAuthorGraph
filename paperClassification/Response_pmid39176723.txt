Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing a large dataset to establish prevalence rates of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in Bulgaria. The study uses data mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model, which aligns with OHDSI's standards for data harmonization, but the primary goal is to produce clinical evidence about disease prevalence and patterns. The research does not primarily focus on developing new methodologies, software tools, or advancing data standards, but rather on applying existing OHDSI tools and standards to answer clinical questions. Therefore, the most appropriate category is "Clinical evidence generation," as the study aims to characterize disease natural history and provide insights into public health strategies.

Final category: 4
