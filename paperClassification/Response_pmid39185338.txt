Discussion: This publication focuses on aligning the IDERHA project with the European Health Data Space (EHDS) requirements, particularly for the secondary use of health data. It emphasizes the use of data standards, including OMOP, FHIR, and DICOM, to enable semantic interoperability and health data exchange. The study also discusses the challenges of refining and extending these standards, such as mapping between FHIR and OMOP and representing patient-generated health data. Given the focus on standardization approaches, terminologies, and frameworks, this publication aligns most closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as it contributes to maintaining and extending the OMOP common data model and related standards for interoperability and data quality.

While the publication touches on technical aspects and infrastructure development, it does not primarily focus on methodological research, open-source software development, or clinical evidence generation. Instead, its primary contribution is to the standardization and alignment of health data frameworks, which is central to the Open community data standards category.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
