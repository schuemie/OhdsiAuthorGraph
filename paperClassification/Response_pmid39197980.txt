Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence through a large-scale, multinational analysis to compare the cardiovascular effectiveness of various second-line antihyperglycemic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The study employs advanced statistical methods, such as propensity score modeling and meta-analysis, to emulate target trials and produce robust evidence on treatment outcomes. While the study uses methodological approaches and standardized data from the LEGEND-T2DM network, its primary goal is to produce actionable clinical evidence to inform treatment decisions. Therefore, the publication aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as it aims to characterize treatment utilization and estimate the effects of medical interventions for comparative effectiveness.
