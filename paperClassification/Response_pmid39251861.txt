Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the limitations of NHIC claim code-based surveillance and advocating for the implementation of a UDI system to improve post-market surveillance (PMS) of medical devices in Korea. The study critically examines the compatibility and effectiveness of NHIC claim codes and UDIs, aiming to enhance the accuracy of medical device identification and tracking for generating real-world evidence (RWE). While the study leverages the OMOP common data model (CDM) and contributes to the activation of multi-institutional research, its primary focus is on generating clinical evidence related to medical device surveillance and improving methodologies for PMS. This aligns most closely with the category of **Clinical evidence generation**, as the study seeks to produce evidence characterizing the utilization and safety of medical devices and proposes improvements to surveillance systems.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
