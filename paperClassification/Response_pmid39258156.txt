Discussion: This publication focuses on a clinical study investigating the association between telmisartan and hearing loss among patients with hypertension. The study uses data from the OMOP Common Data Model and employs methods such as propensity score matching to analyze the comparative effects of telmisartan versus other antihypertensive drugs. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about the protective effects of telmisartan on hearing loss, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation within the OHDSI community. While the study utilizes standardized data and methodological approaches, its primary focus is on producing evidence to inform clinical practice rather than advancing data standards, methodological research, or software development.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
