Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing medication errors (MEs) using the EudraVigilance database, characterizing individual case safety reports, and identifying signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) across sexes and age groups. The study employs statistical methods to detect SDRs and provides insights into the patterns and characteristics of MEs, which could inform further research and interventions. While the study involves methodological aspects such as signal detection and statistical analysis, its primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about medication errors, their distribution, and their impact on different populations. The findings aim to inform stakeholders about potential areas for improvement in medication safety and prevention strategies, aligning closely with the goals of clinical evidence generation.

Final category: **4. Clinical evidence generation**
