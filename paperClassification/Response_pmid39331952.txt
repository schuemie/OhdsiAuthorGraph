Discussion: This publication focuses on the implementation of the OMOP common data model within electronic medical record (EMR) systems and evaluates its impact on health care quality. The study uses methodologies such as factor analysis, the best-worst method, and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory techniques to assess the effectiveness of the implementation. The emphasis on the OMOP model suggests alignment with the **Open community data standards** category, as the study evaluates the application of a shared data model central to OHDSI's mission of standardizing health data. However, the study does not appear to focus on developing new methodologies, software tools, or generating clinical evidence, which would align with the other categories.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
