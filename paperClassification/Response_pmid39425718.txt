Discussion: The publication discusses the role of OHDSI in enabling large-scale, collaborative research in hand surgery by addressing limitations such as bias, lack of generalizability, and challenges in studying rare conditions. It highlights the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) for standardizing healthcare data and mentions OHDSI's suite of open-source tools for research stages, including data extraction and statistical modeling. While the article touches on multiple aspects of OHDSI's contributions, its primary focus appears to be on the application of OHDSI's infrastructure and methodologies to generate clinical evidence in hand surgery research. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the publication emphasizes the use of OHDSI tools and standards to enhance research depth and improve patient care outcomes.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
