Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence about lung cancer in the United Kingdom, including its incidence, prevalence, and survival trends over a 21-year period. The study uses population-based cohort data from UK primary care databases to characterize disease natural history and treatment outcomes. The methods employed, such as Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, are standard epidemiological approaches for evidence generation. The primary goal of the study is to provide insights into the burden of lung cancer and its trends, which aligns with the OHDSI collaboration category of "Clinical evidence generation." While the study may indirectly rely on standardized data models or methodological tools, its primary focus is on producing clinical evidence rather than developing standards, methods, or software.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
