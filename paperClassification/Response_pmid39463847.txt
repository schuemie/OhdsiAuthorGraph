Discussion: This publication focuses on integrating longitudinal mental health data into a staging database using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and metadata standards like DDI-Lifecycle. The study emphasizes the development of a schema and ETL scripts to ensure data quality, interoperability, and standardization for subsequent integration into the OMOP CDM. The work aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and applying open community data standards, particularly the OMOP CDM and standardized vocabularies, as it addresses challenges in data mapping, transformation, and quality assessment. While the publication touches on aspects of ETL development and data integration, its primary focus is on leveraging and adhering to established standards for data harmonization and interoperability, which falls under the category of **Open community data standards**.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
