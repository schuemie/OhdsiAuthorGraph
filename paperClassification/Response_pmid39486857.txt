Discussion: This publication focuses on disparities in the time to diagnosis of radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA) and uses data from the OHDSI network to analyze clinical documentation and diagnostic delays. The study employs statistical modeling to estimate differences in diagnostic delay based on social determinants of health, such as sex, race, ethnicity, and social needs. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about diagnostic delays and their association with social factors, which can inform strategies to improve care delivery. This aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study uses observational data to characterize disease natural history and treatment patterns, and to produce evidence that can guide clinical practice.

While the study employs statistical methods (which could suggest a connection to **Methodological research**), the focus is not on developing or evaluating new analytic approaches but rather on applying established methods to answer a clinical question. Additionally, the study does not involve the development of open-source tools or data standards, ruling out the **Open source development** and **Open community data standards** categories.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
