Discussion: The publication focuses on developing a novel distributed algorithm for regression analysis of binary data, specifically addressing sparse data bias and improving relative risk estimation. The paper evaluates the performance of the method through simulations and real-world case studies, emphasizing methodological advancements in statistical analysis. This aligns closely with the goals of **Methodological research**, as the work contributes to the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches to improve scientific best practices in statistics and epidemiology. While the study uses real-world data to validate the method, the primary focus is on the methodological innovation rather than generating clinical evidence or creating software tools.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
