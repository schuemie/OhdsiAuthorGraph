**Discussion:**  
This publication focuses on creating a reproducible framework for generating disease phenotypes using real-world data mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model. It describes a structured 14-step phenotyping process, the use of bespoke R packages for codelist generation and cohort creation, and diagnostic checks to validate the cohorts. The emphasis on phenotyping methods and tools suggests a focus on methodological rigor and reproducibility in observational studies. Additionally, the use of OMOP-mapped databases and standardized processes aligns with OHDSI's goals of ensuring consistency and reliability in evidence generation.

The publication could potentially fall into two categories:  
1. **Methodological research**: The paper outlines a structured framework for phenotyping, which involves developing and evaluating analytic approaches to ensure scientific best practices. The focus on reproducibility and traceability aligns with methodological research.  
2. **Clinical evidence generation**: The study generates cohorts for pancreatic cancer and systemic lupus erythematosus, performs diagnostic checks, and compares findings to published literature, which contributes to evidence generation.  

However, the primary focus of the publication is on the development and application of a reproducible phenotyping framework, rather than directly testing clinical hypotheses or estimating treatment effects. This aligns more closely with **methodological research**, as the paper emphasizes the process and tools for reliable phenotype generation rather than the clinical insights derived from the cohorts.

**Final category:** 2. **Methodological research**
