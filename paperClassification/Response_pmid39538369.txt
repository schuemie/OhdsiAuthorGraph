Discussion: This publication focuses on the use of a health information exchange standardized to the OMOP common data model (HIE-CDM) to facilitate semantic data flow for a learning health system. It highlights the transformation of health data into the OMOP CDM, reducing data heterogeneity and enabling population health research. The study demonstrates the application of the OMOP CDM in tracking disease risk, prevention practices, and health outcomes, which aligns with the goals of maintaining and applying open community data standards. While the study involves generating clinical evidence (e.g., ASCVD risk tracking and statin usage), the primary focus is on the standardization of data and the infrastructure that supports observational research, which is central to the open community data standards category.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
