Discussion: This publication focuses on improving the accuracy of drug name mapping across international vocabularies by integrating a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) algorithm with a large language model (LLM). The study evaluates the efficacy of this approach compared to traditional methods, such as vector similarity techniques, and demonstrates its superior performance. The work primarily involves methodological innovation in informatics and computational techniques to enhance drug term mapping, which is a critical aspect of standardizing vocabularies and ensuring interoperability in healthcare data systems. While the study contributes to the broader goal of improving data standards, its primary focus is on developing and evaluating analytic approaches, making it most aligned with **Methodological research**.
