Discussion: This publication focuses on conducting an international network cohort study to estimate the incidence of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms across multiple countries using routinely collected healthcare data. The study leverages the OMOP Common Data Model for standardization and performs analyses to generate clinical evidence about the natural history and burden of post-acute COVID-19 symptoms. The primary goal is to produce evidence characterizing disease outcomes and comparing the infected cohort with the general population. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on testing clinical hypotheses and generating evidence about disease epidemiology and outcomes.

While the study uses standardized data models (related to **Open community data standards**) and employs statistical methods (related to **Methodological research**), these aspects are secondary to the primary focus of generating clinical evidence. The publication does not primarily focus on developing new methodologies or software tools, so **Methodological research** and **Open source development** are less applicable.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
