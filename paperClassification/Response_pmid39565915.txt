Discussion: This publication focuses on identifying predictors of persistent opioid use after total joint arthroplasty using a predictive model based on data from the OMOP Common Data Model. The study involves clinical evidence generation by analyzing patient data to characterize outcomes and risk factors associated with opioid use. The use of a predictive model (LASSO logistic regression) suggests an element of methodological research, as it involves statistical modeling to identify factors associated with the outcome. However, the primary focus of the study is on generating clinical evidence to inform strategies for reducing opioid reliance, rather than advancing methodological approaches or software development.

Given the emphasis on understanding clinical outcomes and generating evidence to inform medical practice, the publication aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category.
