Discussion: This publication primarily focuses on the use of the Julia programming language and its associated software for physiological signal analysis, emphasizing its suitability for open and reproducible science. The article highlights the advantages of Julia's open-source ecosystem, its strong package manager, and its ability to facilitate reproducible research. While the content touches on aspects of open science and software development, the emphasis is on the creation and use of software tools for analysis, which aligns closely with the goals of open-source development within the OHDSI community. The publication does not directly address clinical evidence generation, methodological research, or community data standards, but rather focuses on the development and use of software tools for scientific analysis.

Final category: 3. Open source development
