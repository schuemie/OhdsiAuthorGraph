Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the suitability of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) for mapping research datasets, specifically using a multicenter registry as an example. It involves designing and implementing an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process, assessing data quality, and evaluating the mapping process and tools. The emphasis on the OMOP CDM and the ETL process aligns closely with the activities of maintaining and applying open community data standards, as it directly pertains to the use and evaluation of the OMOP CDM for a specific purpose. While the study involves some methodological aspects (e.g., evaluating the mapping process), its primary focus is on the application and assessment of the OMOP CDM and related tools, which falls under the category of open community data standards.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
