Discussion: This publication focuses on developing and validating machine learning-based prediction models for hospital length of stay (LoS) using data standardized to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The study leverages standardized data structures and vocabularies from the OMOP CDM to ensure reproducibility and generalizability of the predictive models. While the use of the OMOP CDM aligns with the principles of open community data standards, the primary focus of the study is on generating clinical evidence through predictive modeling. The research aims to produce actionable insights for hospital resource management and patient care coordination, which falls under the domain of clinical evidence generation. Additionally, the study employs machine learning algorithms and evaluates their performance, but the emphasis is not on methodological research or open-source software development.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
