Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence regarding the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers and the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly the first booster dose, during different waves of the pandemic. The study involves a multi-country observational cohort and uses statistical methods to estimate vaccine effectiveness. While the study employs methodological approaches (e.g., Cox regression) and relies on standardized data collection processes, its primary aim is to produce clinical evidence to inform public health interventions. Therefore, the publication aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as it seeks to characterize disease patterns and evaluate medical interventions.
