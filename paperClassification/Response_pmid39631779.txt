Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a graph model for the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and evaluating its performance in terms of database building time, query complexity, and runtime. The work involves creating a method to transform relational databases into graph database schemas, specifically tailored for the OMOP CDM. This aligns with the **Open community data standards** category, as it contributes to the maintenance and evolution of the OMOP CDM by proposing a new schema transformation approach that can be reused across research institutions. While the study involves technical development and performance evaluation, its primary focus is on enhancing the data standards and structure of the OMOP CDM, rather than creating software tools (Open source development) or conducting clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
