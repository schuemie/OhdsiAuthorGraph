Discussion: The publication focuses on harmonizing healthcare data elements across various health data standards, including OMOP, HL7 FHIR, CDISC, Phenopackets, and openEHR. It emphasizes identifying underlying concepts, clustering similar concepts, and constructing reusable mappings using semantic frameworks like RDF and SSSOM. This work aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and improving data standards, as it addresses the challenge of heterogeneity in healthcare data and proposes a systematic approach to harmonize data elements across standards. The focus on data harmonization and mapping practices suggests that the publication contributes to the development and refinement of open community data standards, particularly in the context of the OMOP common data model and standardized vocabularies.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
