Discussion: This publication focuses on clinical evidence generation by conducting a large-scale cohort study to investigate the association between mismatch repair (MMR) status and surgical outcomes in localized colorectal cancer. The study uses patient-level data from multiple registries and employs statistical methods such as propensity score matching to analyze survival outcomes. The primary goal is to produce evidence characterizing disease prognosis and treatment outcomes, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation within the OHDSI community. While the study may involve methodological aspects (e.g., matching techniques and survival analysis), its primary focus is on generating clinical insights rather than developing or evaluating analytic methods or software tools.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
