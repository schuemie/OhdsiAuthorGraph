Discussion: This publication focuses on the clinical characterization and outcomes of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) across multiple countries using observational healthcare data. The study employs a federated network of databases and a unified data and analysis framework to generate insights into disease trends, demographics, and pre-diagnosis symptoms. The emphasis is on generating clinical evidence through descriptive cohort analysis and making the findings publicly available as an open resource for clinicians and researchers. While the study leverages standardized data and methods, its primary goal is to produce clinical evidence and insights into disease natural history and treatment patterns, which aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category.
