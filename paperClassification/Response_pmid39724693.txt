Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the relative effectiveness of second booster COVID-19 vaccines in healthcare workers through a prospective cohort study. The study involves generating clinical evidence about vaccine effectiveness, which is a key aspect of understanding treatment utilization and estimating the effects of medical interventions. The methodology includes statistical analysis (Cox regression) to calculate relative vaccine effectiveness, but the primary focus is on producing evidence to inform clinical decision-making regarding vaccination strategies. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to characterize the impact of medical interventions (COVID-19 vaccines) and provide actionable insights for healthcare policy and practice.
