Discussion: The publication focuses on the development of a repeatable Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline for converting health data from HL7 CDA documents into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). This work emphasizes the importance of structured and high-quality data transformation, addressing challenges in harmonizing coding systems and extracting data from free-text sections. The study aligns closely with the goals of the OHDSI community in ensuring data quality and standardization for research purposes. Given the focus on ETL processes and the transformation of real-world data into the OMOP CDM, this publication is most relevant to the category of **Open community data standards**, which includes maintaining the OMOP CDM and community conventions for ETL and data quality assessment.

While the publication does involve methodological aspects (e.g., iterative pipeline development and error correction), its primary contribution is the creation of a repeatable ETL pipeline for data extraction and transformation, which is foundational to the OHDSI community's data standardization efforts. It does not primarily focus on developing new analytic methods, software tools, or generating clinical evidence, which would align it with other categories.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
