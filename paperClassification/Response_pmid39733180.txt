Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing the association between long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The study uses a nationwide database encoded in the OMOP Common Data Model to conduct a comparative analysis between PPI users and histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) users. The methodology includes propensity score matching and statistical modeling to estimate the incidence rate and risk ratios. While the study leverages the OMOP-CDM for data standardization, its primary focus is on producing clinical evidence regarding drug safety and disease progression. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this publication is **Clinical evidence generation**, as it aligns with the goal of testing clinical hypotheses and generating evidence about treatment effects and disease outcomes.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
