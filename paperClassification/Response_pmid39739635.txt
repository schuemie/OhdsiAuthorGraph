Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and validation of a rule-based phenotyping algorithm to identify and stratify patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using electronic health record (EHR) data. The study leverages the OMOP Common Data Model to query structured and unstructured data elements, demonstrating the utility of standardized data formats for clinical research. While the work involves methodological aspects, such as the creation of the phenotyping algorithm, its primary goal is to generate clinical evidence by identifying and characterizing NAFLD patients across multiple healthcare systems. The validation of the algorithm and its application to produce clinically relevant insights about disease phenotypes and fibrosis scoring align closely with the goals of clinical evidence generation.

The publication does not primarily focus on developing new data standards (Category 1) or open-source software tools (Category 3). While it involves methodological research (Category 2) in the form of algorithm development, the emphasis is on applying the algorithm to generate actionable clinical evidence about NAFLD patients, which is the hallmark of Category 4.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
