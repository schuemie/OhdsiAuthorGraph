Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating and comparing mappings between ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification) and RxNorm within the OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies (OSV) and the UMLS Metathesaurus. The study assesses the completeness and concordance of these mappings, which are critical for drug data representation and interoperability in clinical decision support systems. The work aligns closely with the maintenance and evaluation of OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies, which are part of the community's efforts to establish open community data standards. The focus is not on developing new methodologies, software tools, or generating clinical evidence, but rather on ensuring the quality and utility of existing standardized vocabularies.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
