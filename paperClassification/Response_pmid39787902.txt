Discussion: This publication focuses on using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to investigate the incidence and risk factors of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) associated with oral anticoagulants. The study involves converting clinical codes into the CDM format and analyzing real-world data to generate clinical evidence about the risks associated with different anticoagulants. While the study utilizes the OMOP CDM, its primary goal is to produce clinical evidence regarding disease outcomes and treatment risks, rather than contributing to the development or maintenance of the CDM itself. Additionally, the study does not focus on methodological research or open-source software development but rather on generating evidence to inform clinical practice.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
