Discussion: The publication describes the development of FHIR PIT, an open-source software pipeline designed to integrate patient-level EHR data with geospatial and spatiotemporal environmental exposure data. The focus is on creating a modular tool that facilitates data integration and supports clinical research. This aligns closely with the **Open source development** category, as the primary contribution is the creation of a software tool that enables consistent and reproducible processes for integrating diverse data types. While the study also involves generating clinical evidence by exploring relationships between environmental exposures and health outcomes, the emphasis of the manuscript is on the technical development and application of the FHIR PIT tool, making **Open source development** the most appropriate category.

Final category: 3
