Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a novel technique to identify a constrained set of predictors for multiple outcome prediction tasks. The research involves evaluating the performance of models using these predictors across various prediction tasks and comparing them to existing models. The emphasis is on methodological innovation in predictive modeling, which aligns with the development and evaluation of analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices in statistics and informatics. While the study indirectly contributes to clinical evidence generation by enabling better prognostic models, its primary focus is on the methodology for predictor selection and model evaluation.
