Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a machine-learning prediction model for diagnostic screening of severe hematological adverse events in cancer patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The study uses the OMOP Common Data Model to structure electronic medical records and applies machine-learning algorithms to generate clinical insights. While the study leverages the OMOP CDM, its primary focus is on generating clinical evidence through predictive modeling to improve diagnostic screening and treatment outcomes. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence for disease interception and precision medicine through predictive analytics.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
