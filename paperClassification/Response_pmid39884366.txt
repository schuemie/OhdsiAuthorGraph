Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing real-world data from multiple institutions to explore the relationship between age-related eye diseases and mental disorders in older adults. The study employs statistical methods such as propensity score matching, Cox proportional hazards models, and meta-analysis to produce evidence about disease associations and risks. The primary goal is to characterize the natural history of age-related eye diseases and their impact on mental health outcomes, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation within the OHDSI community. While the study uses standardized methods and tools, its focus is not on developing new methodologies, software, or data standards, but rather on producing actionable clinical insights.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
