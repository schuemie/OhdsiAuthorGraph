Discussion: This publication focuses on mapping structured ophthalmology examination data from electronic health records (EHRs) to the OMOP common data model (CDM) and identifying gaps in concept coverage. The primary goal is to evaluate and improve the OMOP CDM's ability to represent ophthalmology-specific data elements. This aligns closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as it involves maintaining and enhancing the OMOP CDM and standardized vocabularies to better support data integration and consistency in a specific clinical domain (ophthalmology). While the study involves descriptive analysis and qualitative evaluation, its focus is not on developing new methodologies, software tools, or generating clinical evidence, which rules out the other categories.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
