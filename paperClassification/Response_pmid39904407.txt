Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the performance of a statistical method, the Prior Knowledge-Guided Integrated Likelihood Estimation (PIE), in reducing bias in association studies using electronic health records (EHR). The study involves simulation-based assessments of bias, type I error, and statistical power, as well as comparisons with a na√Øve method. The emphasis is on methodological evaluation and statistical inference, which aligns with the development and empirical evaluation of analytic approaches to determine scientific best practices. This work does not focus on creating software tools, generating clinical evidence, or maintaining data standards, but rather on advancing methodological research.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
