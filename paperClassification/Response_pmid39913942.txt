Discussion: The publication describes the development of a data pipeline, Victoria, for the French claims database (SNDS). The pipeline focuses on automating and streamlining processes for data cleaning, transformation, and modeling to support epidemiological and medico-economic research. It emphasizes scalability, compliance with regulatory requirements, and data quality assessment. While the paper mentions ongoing work toward OMOP conversion, the primary focus is on creating a pragmatic data model and pipeline for real-world evidence (RWE) generation. This aligns most closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as it involves creating conventions and processes for data transformation and quality assessment. However, it also has elements of **Open source development**, as it describes a pipeline implementation, and **Clinical evidence generation**, as the pipeline has been used for published studies. Despite these overlaps, the emphasis on data modeling and transformation for standardization purposes makes **Open community data standards** the most appropriate category.
