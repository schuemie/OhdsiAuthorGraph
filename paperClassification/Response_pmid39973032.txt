Discussion: The publication focuses on analyzing treatment patterns using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and provides a scoping review of studies that leverage CDM-based approaches for observational research. It highlights the use of standardized tools and methodologies, such as ATLAS and the R package "TreatmentPatterns," to visualize and analyze treatment patterns. While the study emphasizes the utility of the CDM for enabling multinational observational network studies, the primary focus is on generating clinical evidence about treatment patterns and utilization across various diseases. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the publication is centered on producing evidence characterizing treatment utilization and patterns.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
