Discussion: This publication focuses on conducting a large-scale, multinational network cohort study to assess the risk of aortic aneurysm or dissection following the use of fluoroquinolones. The study involves generating clinical evidence by analyzing data from multiple databases across different countries, applying rigorous statistical methods, and calibrating results using negative control outcomes. The primary goal is to produce evidence about the safety of fluoroquinolones compared to other antibiotics in the context of treating urinary tract infections. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on testing a clinical hypothesis and producing evidence related to the safety of medical interventions.

While the study employs methodological rigor and statistical techniques, its primary focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies (which would fall under **Methodological research**) or creating software tools (which would fall under **Open source development**). Additionally, it does not involve maintaining or developing data standards (which would fall under **Open community data standards**).

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
