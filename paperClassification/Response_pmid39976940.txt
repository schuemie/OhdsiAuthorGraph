Discussion: This publication investigates the association between semaglutide, a medication for type 2 diabetes, and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) using a retrospective study across multiple databases in the OHDSI network. The study employs advanced epidemiological methods, including active-comparator cohort designs and self-controlled case-series analyses, to generate clinical evidence about the safety of semaglutide. The focus is on generating evidence to characterize the risk of NAION associated with semaglutide use, which aligns with the goal of clinical evidence generation. While the study uses methodological approaches, its primary aim is not to develop or evaluate new methods but to produce actionable clinical insights.

Final category: **4. Clinical evidence generation**
