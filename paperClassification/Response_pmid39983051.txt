Discussion: This publication primarily focuses on the use of standardized data models, specifically the OMOP-CDM and the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM), to harmonize electronic medical record (EMR) data and medical imaging data for multi-institutional collaborative research. The study demonstrates the application of these standards to analyze retinal thickness in patients with chronic diseases. While the research involves clinical evidence generation through the analysis of retinal thickness changes, the core contribution of the study lies in the standardization of medical imaging data (OCT images) and its integration with the OMOP-CDM. This aligns closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as the work emphasizes the development and application of standardized data models to enable efficient and reproducible research.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
