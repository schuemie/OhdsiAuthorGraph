Discussion: This publication focuses on a target trial emulation study to evaluate the risk of depression among older adults with type 2 diabetes who are treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to other treatments. The study uses real-world data from U.S. National Medicare administrative records and applies statistical methods (e.g., Cox proportional hazards regression) to generate clinical evidence about the comparative safety and effectiveness of these treatments. The primary goal is to produce evidence characterizing the relationship between GLP-1RAs and depression risk, which aligns with the OHDSI collaboration category of **Clinical evidence generation**. While the study employs methodological approaches, its primary focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies but rather on generating evidence to inform clinical decision-making.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
