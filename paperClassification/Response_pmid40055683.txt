Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by conducting a multinational cohort study to investigate the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19. The study uses electronic medical records and claims data from multiple countries to estimate the risks of various psychiatric and neuropsychiatric disorders following COVID-19 infection. The methodology involves matching cohorts, applying statistical models, and analyzing outcomes over different time periods. While the study employs methodological approaches and data standards, its primary goal is to produce clinical evidence about disease outcomes and risks associated with COVID-19. Therefore, the most appropriate category is "Clinical evidence generation," as the study aims to characterize disease natural history and treatment utilization, and estimate the effects of COVID-19 on mental health outcomes.
