**Discussion:**  
The publication titled "Real-world evidence for regulatory purposes: The example of DARWIN EU®" appears to focus on the use of real-world evidence (RWE) in regulatory contexts, specifically through the DARWIN EU® initiative. DARWIN EU® is a European network designed to generate and utilize real-world evidence for regulatory decision-making, often leveraging the OHDSI framework and methodologies. This suggests that the publication is likely centered on clinical evidence generation, as it involves conducting studies to produce evidence that informs regulatory decisions, characterizes disease natural history, and evaluates treatment utilization or intervention effects. While methodological research and open community data standards might play supporting roles in enabling such studies, the primary focus of this publication seems to be on the application of real-world evidence for clinical and regulatory purposes.
