Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and application of computable phenotype algorithms using the OMOP Common Data Model to identify patients with neurofibromatosis type 1-related optic pathway glioma in an electronic health records database. The study involves creating algorithms based on diagnosis codes, visits, and radiologic procedures, and evaluating their performance in identifying cases. While the work leverages the OMOP CDM (a key component of OHDSI's open community data standards), the primary focus is on generating clinical evidence by identifying patients with a specific condition and assessing the utility of these algorithms for patient screening and research purposes. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence that can be used in clinical research and trials for rare diseases.
