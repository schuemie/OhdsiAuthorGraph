Discussion: The publication describes the development of LinkR, an open-source, low-code platform designed to facilitate healthcare data analysis and visualization. The platform is based on the OMOP Common Data Model and aims to democratize access to clinical data warehouses, enabling users to manipulate, visualize, and analyze healthcare data without requiring advanced programming skills. It also emphasizes collaboration through features like Git integration. Given the focus on creating software tools that operationalize best practices for data analysis and visualization, this publication aligns most closely with the **Open source development** category. While the platform leverages the OMOP Common Data Model (related to open community data standards), its primary contribution is the creation of a software tool, which is central to open source development.
