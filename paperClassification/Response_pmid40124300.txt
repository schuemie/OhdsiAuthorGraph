Discussion: This publication focuses on creating a dataset that maps Japanese pharmaceutical data to RxNorm, a standardized drug terminology used in OHDSI. The work aligns with the goal of enabling the integration of Japanese real-world data into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and OHDSI Standard Vocabulary (OSV). This effort is critical for ensuring adherence to OHDSI's open community data standards, as it facilitates the transformation of local terminologies into internationally recognized standards. The publication does not primarily focus on developing new methodologies, software tools, or conducting clinical evidence generation studies, but rather on supporting the standardization of data for broader use within the OHDSI community.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
