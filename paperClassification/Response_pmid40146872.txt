Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and validation of a tool that automates the mapping of clinical data to the OMOP Common Data Model using large language models. The tool aims to reduce technical barriers for researchers, particularly smaller teams, to standardize their data and participate in large-scale data-sharing initiatives. The study involves creating software that leverages semantic matching and machine learning techniques to facilitate the transformation of diverse clinical data into the OMOP format. The emphasis on creating an open-source implementation aligns with the goals of enabling reproducible processes and accessibility for the broader research community.

Given the focus on developing a software tool that automates a critical step in the data standardization process, the publication aligns most closely with the **Open source development** category. While the tool indirectly supports the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (which could relate to the **Open community data standards** category), the primary contribution is the creation and validation of a software solution, making **Open source development** the most appropriate classification.

Final category: 3
