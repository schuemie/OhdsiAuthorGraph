Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence about colorectal cancer incidence and survival trends in the United Kingdom over a 21-year period. The study uses population-based data to characterize disease natural history and treatment outcomes, which aligns with the goals of clinical evidence generation. The analysis of incidence rates and survival outcomes provides insights into disease patterns and highlights areas for improvement in diagnosis and management. While the study leverages standardized data sources (CPRD GOLD and CPRD Aurum), its primary focus is not on developing data standards, methodological research, or open-source tools, but rather on producing actionable clinical evidence.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
