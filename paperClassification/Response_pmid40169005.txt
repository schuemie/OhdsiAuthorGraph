Discussion: The publication discusses integrative data science approaches in drug safety research, highlighting challenges such as interoperability and data protection. It mentions the OMOP common data model and platforms like EHDEN and DARWIN EU, which are central to OHDSI's efforts in standardizing and sharing clinical data. These aspects align with the **Open community data standards** category, as they focus on maintaining and utilizing standardized data models and vocabularies for collaborative research. Additionally, the article touches on generating virtual control groups and integrating data for drug safety assessment, which could relate to **Clinical evidence generation**, as it involves using shared data to produce evidence in drug safety. However, the primary focus appears to be on the infrastructure and standards that enable such research, rather than the direct generation of clinical evidence.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
