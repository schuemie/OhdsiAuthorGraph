Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing the association between LDL-C levels and dementia risk using a distributed network analysis based on the OMOP Common Data Model. The study involves conducting a network study across multiple institutions, applying statistical methods like propensity score matching, and producing evidence related to disease outcomes and treatment effects. While the study leverages the OMOP CDM (which is part of the open community data standards), its primary focus is on clinical evidence generation rather than the development or maintenance of data standards, methodological research, or open-source software tools.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
