Discussion: The publication focuses on the development and use of Carrot, an open-source software tool designed to assist in converting sensitive healthcare data to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The tool emphasizes privacy by design, standardization of the data curation process, and reuse of rules to improve efficiency and quality. While the article touches on the importance of data standards (which aligns with the "Open community data standards" category), the primary focus is on the creation and implementation of a software tool to facilitate the ETL process for converting data to the OMOP CDM. This aligns most closely with the "Open source development" category, as the publication describes the development of a software tool that supports the community in executing data conversion processes in a reproducible and standardized manner.

Final category: 3. Open source development
