Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing heat-related illness (HRI) and excess sun exposure rates across different climatic zones in the United States, using data from a large cohort over a multi-year period. The study generates clinical evidence by characterizing disease natural history (HRI and sun exposure patterns), identifying at-risk populations, and exploring correlations with environmental factors like temperature. The findings aim to inform public health interventions, such as heat safety protocols and sun protection campaigns. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is primarily focused on producing evidence to understand disease patterns and inform interventions.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
