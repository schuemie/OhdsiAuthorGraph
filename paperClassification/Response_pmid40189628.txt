Discussion: This publication focuses on the adoption of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) for cancer research using real-world data. It reviews how the OMOP CDM has been utilized to support data analysis and infrastructure for cancer studies, highlighting its role in enabling collaborative research and identifying areas for improvement. The emphasis on the OMOP CDM and its ecosystem suggests a connection to the **Open community data standards** category, as the CDM is a foundational standard within OHDSI for harmonizing data across studies. While the article touches on analytics and infrastructure, its primary focus is on the adoption and development of the OMOP CDM, which aligns most closely with the community's efforts to maintain and expand data standards.
