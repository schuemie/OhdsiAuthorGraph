Discussion: The publication focuses on the development of a metadata-driven ETL process to transform FHIR data into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). This work is directly related to the standardization of data formats and the creation of processes for extracting, transforming, and loading data into the OMOP CDM. The emphasis on ETL processes and the transformation of heterogeneous data formats into a standardized model aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and improving open community data standards. While the work involves technical development, its primary focus is on ensuring data uniformity and adherence to the OMOP CDM, which is a core aspect of open community data standards rather than open source software development or methodological research.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
