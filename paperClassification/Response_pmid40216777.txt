Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence regarding the cardiovascular outcomes in children and adolescents following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study uses electronic health records to assess risks and outcomes, which aligns with the goal of producing evidence to characterize disease natural history and treatment utilization. The research does not primarily focus on developing data standards, methodological approaches, or open-source tools, but rather on conducting a network study to test clinical hypotheses and provide actionable insights for healthcare management. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this publication is "Clinical evidence generation."
