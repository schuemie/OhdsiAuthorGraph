Discussion: The publication focuses on the importance of open-source implementations in the context of open health data standards, specifically discussing the alignment of openEHR, FHIR, and OMOP for different use cases. It emphasizes the role of open standards in achieving health data interoperability and provides practical guidelines for adapting these standards to specific contexts, such as federated learning and health data sharing in low- and middle-income countries. While the article touches on the OMOP common data model, its primary focus is on the broader ecosystem of open standards and their implementation, rather than the maintenance of the OMOP model itself. Additionally, the discussion of open-source software and its role in enabling interoperability suggests a connection to open-source development. However, the article does not appear to focus on creating specific software tools or conducting network studies for clinical evidence generation. Instead, it is more aligned with the conceptual and methodological aspects of data standardization and interoperability.

Final category: **Open community data standards**
