Discussion: This publication focuses on identifying risk factors for ICU admission in children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using data transformed into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The study involves clinical evidence generation, as it uses real-world data to analyze disease outcomes and risk factors, specifically aiming to predict ICU admission risk. While the study leverages the OMOP CDM, its primary focus is not on developing or maintaining data standards, methodological research, or open-source tools. Instead, the emphasis is on generating clinical evidence to inform medical decision-making and improve understanding of RSV-related ICU admissions.

Final category: **4. Clinical evidence generation**
