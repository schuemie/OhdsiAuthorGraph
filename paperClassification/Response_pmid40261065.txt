Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a novel computational approach to assess the generalizability of randomized clinical trial (RCT) participants to real-world patients using electronic health record (EHR) data. It introduces a phenotypic distance metric and applies machine learning methods to predict individualized treatment effects. The study is primarily methodological, as it proposes and evaluates new analytic approaches for assessing representativeness and personalized inference in clinical research. While the study generates clinical insights about spironolactone treatment, its primary contribution lies in the methodological innovation rather than direct clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
