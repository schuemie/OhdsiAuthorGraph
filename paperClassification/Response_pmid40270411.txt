Discussion: The publication focuses on the development of a system (FOX BOXes) to enable standardized data sharing of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for secondary use in clinical research. It emphasizes the architecture, functionality, and governance of these systems, which are designed to address challenges such as data fragmentation, legal constraints, and privacy concerns. The paper also discusses the role of standardization and harmonization in facilitating data sharing and advancing data-driven research. Given the focus on creating a technological solution for standardized data sharing, this publication aligns most closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as it deals with standardization efforts and data governance to enable interoperability and data sharing.

While the paper touches on aspects of enabling clinical research and evidence generation, its primary focus is on the infrastructure and standards required for data sharing, rather than conducting specific network studies or generating clinical evidence. It does not primarily focus on methodological research or the development of open-source software tools, but rather on the foundational standards and architecture for data sharing.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
