Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing practice variations in cirrhosis care across multiple medical centers using high-dimensional electronic health record (EHR) data. The study evaluates adherence to clinical guidelines and identifies factors influencing care quality, such as transplant center status and patient race/ethnicity. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about care quality and disparities in cirrhosis management, which aligns with the OHDSI collaboration category of **Clinical evidence generation**. While the study uses methodological approaches (e.g., multivariate logistic regression) and leverages a multicenter EHR database, its focus is not on developing new methods or tools but rather on producing evidence to characterize clinical practice and outcomes.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
