Discussion: The publication describes the development of dsOMOP, a tool that bridges the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and DataSHIELD for secure federated analysis of standardized clinical data. The focus is on creating software packages that enable interoperability between OMOP CDM and DataSHIELD, facilitating privacy-preserving, federated analyses of clinical data. This aligns closely with the **Open source development** category, as the publication emphasizes the creation of software tools (dsOMOP and its associated packages) to support secure and standardized data analysis workflows. While the work indirectly supports clinical evidence generation by enabling federated analyses, its primary contribution is the development of open-source tools that codify best practices for secure data sharing and analysis.

Final category: 3. **Open source development**
