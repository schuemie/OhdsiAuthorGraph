Discussion: The publication describes the PERMANENS project, which focuses on developing a machine learning-based Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for suicide risk management. The project leverages the OMOP Common Data Model to harmonize data from multiple national suicide attempt registries, enabling real-time analysis. This suggests involvement in multiple aspects of the OHDSI collaboration categories. The use of the OMOP CDM aligns with **Open community data standards**, as it involves harmonizing data across registries. The development of the CDSS and its machine learning components could fall under **Open source development**, as it likely involves creating software tools for clinical decision-making. Additionally, the focus on suicide prevention and personalized care aligns with **Clinical evidence generation**, as it aims to produce evidence for improving clinical outcomes.

However, the primary focus of the publication appears to be on the development of a machine learning-based CDSS, which is a software tool designed to assist in clinical decision-making. This aligns most closely with the **Open source development** category, as the project centers on creating a tool that operationalizes best practices for suicide risk management.

Final category: 3. Open source development
