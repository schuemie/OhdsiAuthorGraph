Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a machine learning model for predicting blood transfusion needs in intensive care units using federated learning. The study involves clinical evidence generation by analyzing patient data from two large databases (MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD) to produce actionable insights for clinical decision-making. While the methodology and use of federated learning are innovative, the primary goal is to generate clinical evidence that can improve patient outcomes and resource management. Therefore, the publication aligns most closely with the "Clinical evidence generation" category.
