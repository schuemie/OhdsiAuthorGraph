Discussion: This publication focuses on converting nursing statements into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), which involves mapping data to standardized vocabularies (SNOMED CT) and performing an extract-transform-load (ETL) process to integrate the data into the CDM. This aligns closely with the activities of maintaining and applying the OMOP CDM, standardized vocabularies, and ETL conventions, which are central to the "Open community data standards" category. While the study involves technical processes, such as ETL, the primary focus is on ensuring the data conforms to the community's standards for observational research.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
