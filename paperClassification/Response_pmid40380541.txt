Discussion: The publication "OMOP-on-FHIR: Integrating the Clinical Data Through FHIR Bundle to OMOP CDM" focuses on the integration of HL7 FHIR with the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to enhance interoperability and facilitate data exchange for clinical research. The article describes the use of an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process to transform FHIR Bundles into the OMOP CDM format, emphasizing the importance of maintaining semantic consistency and standardization. This aligns closely with the goals of the **Open community data standards** category, as it involves maintaining and extending the OMOP CDM and ensuring data quality and consistency during the ETL process. While the publication also touches on enabling advanced analytics and personalized medicine, its primary focus is on the technical and methodological aspects of data standardization and integration.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
