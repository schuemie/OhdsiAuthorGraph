Discussion: The publication focuses on the development of a research infrastructure that integrates REDCap and FHIR to consolidate clinical data and support research projects. This infrastructure involves connecting various systems, including OMOP, to a central FHIR repository. While the article mentions OMOP, the emphasis is on the technical implementation and integration of systems for data management and research purposes. This aligns most closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as it involves maintaining and integrating data standards (FHIR and OMOP) to support research workflows. However, it does not delve deeply into methodological research, open-source software development, or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
