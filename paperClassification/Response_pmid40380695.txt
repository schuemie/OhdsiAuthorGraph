Discussion: The publication focuses on evaluating ETL tools for transforming healthcare data into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). This aligns closely with the activities of the OHDSI community related to data standardization and the extract-transform-load (ETL) process, which is a critical step in ensuring that healthcare data conforms to the OMOP CDM. The study does not primarily focus on methodological research, open-source software development, or clinical evidence generation, but rather on assessing tools that facilitate the adoption of the OMOP CDM. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this publication is **Open community data standards**, as it directly relates to maintaining and implementing the OMOP CDM and associated conventions.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
