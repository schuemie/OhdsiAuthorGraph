Discussion: The publication focuses on the challenge of linking disparate datasets within the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) framework, specifically addressing interoperability and integration issues. This work aligns with the broader goal of maintaining and improving the OMOP CDM and ensuring its effective use for integrating data sources. The paper proposes solutions to enhance data integration, which is a critical aspect of ensuring the usability and quality of the OMOP CDM for research purposes. While the work could touch on methodological aspects (e.g., techniques for record linkage) or software development (e.g., tools for data integration), the primary focus appears to be on maintaining and improving the standards and conventions of the OMOP CDM for data integration.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
