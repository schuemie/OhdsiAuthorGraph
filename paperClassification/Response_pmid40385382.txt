Discussion: The publication focuses on generating real-world evidence about the comparative safety of second-line antihyperglycemic agents in older adults with type 2 diabetes. It involves conducting a multinational cohort study using harmonized electronic health record and claims databases, applying a consistent analytical framework, and estimating hazard ratios for various safety outcomes. This type of research aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as it aims to produce evidence characterizing treatment utilization and estimating the effects of medical interventions for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness. While the study employs methodological approaches (e.g., propensity score adjustment and empirical calibration), the primary focus is on generating clinical evidence rather than developing or evaluating new methodologies or software tools.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
