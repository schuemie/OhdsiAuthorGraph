Discussion: This publication focuses on a retrospective cohort study investigating the association between COX-2 selectivity in pain medications and the incidence of endometriosis. The study involves generating clinical evidence by analyzing patient data to test a clinical hypothesis about the effects of specific medications on disease incidence. This aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence characterizing treatment utilization and estimating the effects of medical interventions (COX-2 inhibitors vs. NSAIDs) on endometriosis incidence. The study does not focus on developing data standards, methodological research, or open-source software tools, which are the focus of the other categories.
