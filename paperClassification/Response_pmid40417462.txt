Discussion: This publication focuses on the heterogeneity of phenotype algorithms in observational clinical research and their impact on patient overlap and incidence rate variability. It reviews existing phenotype definitions and highlights the need for transparent and robust research practices. The study does not directly propose new methodological approaches or software tools but rather evaluates existing practices and their implications for clinical evidence generation. While the findings could inform methodological research or open community data standards, the primary focus appears to be on understanding and improving the reproducibility and reliability of clinical evidence generation through better phenotype definitions.

Final category: **Clinical evidence generation**
