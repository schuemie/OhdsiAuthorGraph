Discussion: The publication focuses on optimizing medication querying using an ontology-driven approach integrated with the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). It emphasizes improving query accuracy and efficiency, leveraging semantic ontology structures, and validating the approach with real-world COVID-19 EHR data. The work involves developing a query optimization method and an intuitive interface for querying and visualizing patient history. This suggests a focus on creating tools and methodologies to enhance data querying and analysis processes. While the study uses the OMOP CDM, its primary contribution appears to be the development of a software tool and methodology for querying medication data, which aligns with the goals of open source development.

Final category: **Open source development**
