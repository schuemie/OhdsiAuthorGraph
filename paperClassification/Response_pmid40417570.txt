Discussion: This publication focuses on developing a novel natural language processing (NLP) approach using sentence transformers to improve schema mapping of electronic health records (EHR) to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The primary goal is to enhance the standardization of clinical records, which is a critical step in enabling interoperability and large-scale clinical investigations. The work involves creating and validating a machine learning model for mapping medication-related concepts to standardized concepts in the OMOP CDM. This aligns closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as it directly contributes to the process of mapping EHR data to the OMOP CDM, which is a foundational aspect of maintaining and utilizing the common data model.

While the publication also involves methodological research (developing and evaluating transformer-based NLP models), the primary focus is on schema mapping to the OMOP CDM, which is a core activity within the open community data standards category. The work does not primarily focus on developing software tools (open source development) or generating clinical evidence (clinical evidence generation), as its emphasis is on improving the data standardization process.

Final category: **Open community data standards**
