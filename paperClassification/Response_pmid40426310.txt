Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing treatment patterns for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women using data from tertiary care institutions and a nationwide database. The study leverages the OMOP common data model to generate clinical evidence about prescription trends and changes in treatment practices over time. The primary goal is to characterize disease management and treatment utilization, which aligns with the objectives of clinical evidence generation. While the study uses standardized data models (related to open community data standards), its focus is not on maintaining or developing these standards. Similarly, the publication does not emphasize methodological research or open-source software development.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
