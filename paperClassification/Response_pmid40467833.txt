Discussion: This publication focuses on developing an empirical approach to identify and rank candidate comparators for pharmacoepidemiological studies using observational data. The work introduces a methodology for evaluating comparators based on their similarity in high-dimensional covariate space, which is critical for ensuring balance and appropriateness in new user cohort designs. The study involves large-scale data analysis and the creation of a systematic process for comparator selection, which aligns with methodological research aimed at improving best practices in epidemiology and statistics. While the work could indirectly support clinical evidence generation by improving study designs, its primary focus is on advancing methodological approaches rather than directly generating clinical evidence.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
