Discussion: This publication focuses on the application of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) in China, evaluating its feasibility and implementation for data standardization and evidence sharing. The study highlights the transformation of data into the OMOP CDM by various institutions and platforms, as well as the use of standardized data for predictive modeling and analysis of patient characteristics. The emphasis on the OMOP CDM and its role in enabling cross-regional evidence sharing aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and applying open community data standards. While the study indirectly supports clinical evidence generation through the use of standardized data for predictive modeling, its primary focus is on the adoption and application of the OMOP CDM as a data standard.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
