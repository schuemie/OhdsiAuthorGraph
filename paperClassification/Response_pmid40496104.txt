Discussion: This publication primarily focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing trends in blood lead level (BLL) screening during the COVID-19 pandemic using patient-level electronic health record data. The study leverages the OHDSI ATLAS platform and the OMOP common data model to extract and analyze data, but the primary goal is to produce evidence about the impact of the pandemic on pediatric health care practices and lead exposure. While the use of standardized data models and tools like ATLAS is mentioned, the emphasis is on clinical evidence generation rather than methodological research, open source development, or data standards.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
