Discussion: The publication focuses on assessing algorithmic fairness in disease phenotype definitions, which is a methodological challenge in observational studies. The work introduces a generalized tool to evaluate fairness metrics and provides workflows for disease definitions, emphasizing the importance of accurate and equitable representation of populations. This aligns with the goals of **methodological research**, as it involves developing and evaluating analytic approaches to improve scientific practices in epidemiology and informatics. While the tool itself could be considered part of open source development, the primary focus of the publication is on the methodology for assessing fairness rather than the software development process. The study does not directly involve generating clinical evidence or maintaining data standards, so those categories are less applicable.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
