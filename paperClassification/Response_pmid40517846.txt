Discussion: This publication focuses on conducting a network study to analyze post-acute COVID-19 symptoms across multiple databases and countries. The study uses latent class analysis to identify clusters of symptoms and examines their heterogeneity across healthcare settings. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about the natural history and symptomatology of post-acute COVID-19 condition (PCC). This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to characterize disease presentation and provide insights into clinical definitions of PCC. While the study employs methodological approaches (latent class analysis), its focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies, nor does it involve open source software development or data standards.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
