Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in England and Wales using linked health and administrative data. The study involves generating clinical evidence by estimating age-standardized incidence rates and adjusted hazard ratios for mortality and CVD outcomes across different ethnic groups. The primary goal is to characterize disease natural history and treatment utilization, as well as to identify disparities in health outcomes among diverse populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on producing evidence to better understand disease patterns and outcomes in specific populations.

While the study uses statistical methods and data standards, its focus is not on developing new methodologies or software tools, nor is it about maintaining data standards or vocabularies. Instead, the emphasis is on generating actionable clinical insights through network studies.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
