Discussion: This publication focuses on the implementation and updating of clinical prediction models, which are tools used to predict outcomes in healthcare settings. The study systematically reviews how these models are implemented, validated, and updated, and evaluates their impact on patient care. The emphasis on assessing bias, calibration, external validation, and adherence to best practices aligns with methodological research, as it seeks to evaluate and improve the scientific methods used in prediction modeling. While the study touches on clinical evidence generation by discussing the impact of these models on patient care, its primary focus is on the methodological aspects of prediction model development, validation, and updating.

Final category: **2. Methodological research**
