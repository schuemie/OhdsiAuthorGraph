Discussion: The publication introduces "Jackalope Plus," a tool designed to enhance the mapping of complex health data to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The tool leverages SNOMED CT post-coordination and a GPT-4o mini LLM to improve precision and efficiency in standardizing medical concepts. This aligns closely with the goals of **open source development**, as the tool is a software solution that codifies best practices for data standardization and mapping, enabling reproducible processes in observational health studies. While the tool indirectly supports the use of open community data standards (category 1) by improving mapping to the OMOP CDM, the focus of the publication is on the development and evaluation of the software itself, making category 3 the most appropriate classification.

Final category: 3
