Discussion: This publication focuses on generating clinical evidence by analyzing the relationship between climate change, extreme temperatures, and the incidence of infectious diseases among children and adolescents in China. The study uses a large dataset and employs a case-crossover design to quantify associations between temperature exposure and disease incidence, as well as to evaluate trends over time. The primary goal is to produce evidence characterizing disease patterns and their association with environmental factors, which aligns with the **Clinical evidence generation** category. While the study involves statistical methods and data analysis, its focus is not on developing new methodologies or software tools, nor does it address data standards or ETL processes.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
