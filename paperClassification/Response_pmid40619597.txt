Discussion: This publication focuses on the concept of multi-database distributed data networks in pharmacoepidemiology, emphasizing the use of common data models (CDMs) and common protocols for post-marketing surveillance of drug safety and effectiveness. It discusses the role of networks like OHDSI in standardizing data structures to enable consistent analytic approaches across diverse datasets. The paper also highlights challenges such as data heterogeneity and coding practices, which are relevant to the standardization of evidence and comparability of findings. While the publication touches on clinical evidence generation (e.g., utilization studies and safety/effectiveness studies), its primary focus is on the infrastructure and methodology that underpin these studies, particularly the use of CDMs and distributed networks.

Given the emphasis on the use of CDMs and the challenges of standardization, this publication aligns most closely with the **Open community data standards** category, as it discusses the foundational data structures and conventions that enable multi-database research.
