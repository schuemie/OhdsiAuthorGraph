Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the data quality of surgical oncology cohorts mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) within the All of Us Research Program. The study systematically assesses data quality dimensions such as conformance, completeness, concordance, plausibility, and temporality. The primary focus is on identifying challenges and limitations in the data quality of oncology cohorts, which directly impacts their fitness for use in clinical studies. This aligns closely with the activities of maintaining and assessing the OMOP CDM and standardized vocabularies, as well as ensuring data quality for research purposes. While the study indirectly supports clinical evidence generation by addressing data quality issues, its primary contribution is to the domain of **open community data standards**, as it evaluates and highlights the challenges in using the OMOP CDM for oncology data.

Final category: 1. Open community data standards
