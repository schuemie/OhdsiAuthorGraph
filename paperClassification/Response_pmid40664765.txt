Discussion: The publication introduces COLA-GLM, a federated learning algorithm designed for decentralized observational healthcare data analysis. The focus is on developing a methodological approach to enable efficient and secure collaborative learning across institutions while preserving patient privacy. The algorithm is evaluated empirically and demonstrated to be effective in real-world applications. This aligns closely with the goals of **methodological research**, as the study develops and evaluates an innovative analytic approach to address challenges in decentralized data analysis. While the work indirectly supports clinical evidence generation by enabling collaborative studies, its primary contribution lies in advancing the methodology for federated learning in healthcare.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
