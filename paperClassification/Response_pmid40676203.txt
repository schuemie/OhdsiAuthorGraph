Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and evaluation of a methodological approach, specifically the Negative Control-Calibrated Difference-in-Difference (NC-DiD) method, to address unmeasured confounding in real-world data (RWD) analyses. The study introduces a novel statistical technique and demonstrates its application through simulations and a case study on racial/ethnic disparities in post-COVID-19 health outcomes. The emphasis is on improving causal inference methods in observational studies, which aligns closely with the goals of methodological research within the OHDSI community. While the application of the method generates clinical evidence, the primary focus of the publication is on the development and validation of the NC-DiD methodology itself.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
