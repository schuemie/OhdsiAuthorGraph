Discussion: The publication focuses on developing a distributed learning algorithm, DisC2o-HD, for causal inference in high-dimensional healthcare data. The algorithm addresses challenges such as covariate shift and heterogeneity across clinical sites, and it incorporates methodological innovations like surrogate likelihood methods and covariate balancing propensity score estimators. The emphasis on estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) and achieving semiparametric efficiency bounds suggests a strong focus on advancing analytic approaches and statistical methods for causal inference. While the algorithm is applied to real-world data, the primary contribution lies in the methodological research and development of statistical techniques rather than generating clinical evidence or creating open-source software tools.
