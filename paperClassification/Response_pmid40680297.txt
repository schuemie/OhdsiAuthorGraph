Discussion: This publication focuses on incorporating the DICOM imaging standard into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM), which is a foundational aspect of OHDSI's open community data standards. The work involves parsing DICOM vocabularies, creating structured metadata definitions, and adding custom concepts to the OMOP CDM vocabulary. This effort aligns with the goal of maintaining and expanding the OMOP CDM to support multimodal research, particularly by enabling the integration of imaging data into the standardized framework. While the publication touches on enabling future research and evidence generation, its primary contribution is the development and enhancement of the data standards themselves, which is critical for ensuring interoperability and consistency across observational studies.

Final category: **1. Open community data standards**
