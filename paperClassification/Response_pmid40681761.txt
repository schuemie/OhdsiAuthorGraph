Discussion: This publication focuses on the development of a novel algorithm, COLA-GLMM, designed to improve efficiency and privacy in multi-site collaborative studies. The algorithm addresses methodological challenges in distributed research networks, such as data privacy and administrative burdens, and introduces innovative features like homomorphic encryption and one-shot communication. The study also validates the algorithm through simulation and real-world applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating clinical evidence. While the validation involves clinical evidence generation, the primary focus of the publication is on the development and evaluation of a methodological approach for distributed analyses, which aligns with the goals of methodological research.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
