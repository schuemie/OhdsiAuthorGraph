Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating methods for defining observation periods in real-world data and their impact on incidence rate estimates. The study involves methodological research to assess different approaches and their biases, aiming to identify best practices for defining observation periods in epidemiologic studies. The emphasis on comparing methods and calculating errors aligns with the goal of advancing scientific best practices in statistics and epidemiology. While the findings could inform clinical evidence generation, the primary focus is on the methodological evaluation of data handling techniques rather than directly generating clinical evidence.

Final category: **2. Methodological research**
