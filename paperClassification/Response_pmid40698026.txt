Discussion:  
This publication focuses on the use of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) for federated analysis in benchmarking mortality across critical care registries. It describes challenges encountered during the implementation of the CDM and provides recommendations for improving data preparation, analysis, and interpretation. The study emphasizes the importance of decisions made during the CDM implementation process and suggests strategies to enhance efficiency and accuracy in future analyses. While the study involves clinical evidence generation (benchmarking mortality rates), its primary focus is on the implementation and challenges of using the OMOP CDM for federated analysis, which aligns more closely with the category of **Open community data standards**. This is because the publication discusses the application and refinement of the OMOP CDM, including recommendations for improving its use in real-world scenarios.

Final category: **Open community data standards**
