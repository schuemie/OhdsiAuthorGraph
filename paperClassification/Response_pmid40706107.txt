Discussion: This publication focuses on the development and evaluation of automated approaches for mapping between SIGTAP vocabulary and OMOP CDM concepts using Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is centered on improving the process of vocabulary mapping, which is a critical aspect of maintaining and expanding the utility of the OMOP common data model and standardized vocabularies. The work aligns closely with the goals of the **Open community data standards** category, as it contributes to the integration and harmonization of medical terminologies within the OMOP CDM framework. While the study employs methodological approaches (e.g., LLM-based pipelines), its primary focus is on enhancing the data standards and vocabulary mapping process, rather than developing new analytic methods or generating clinical evidence.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
