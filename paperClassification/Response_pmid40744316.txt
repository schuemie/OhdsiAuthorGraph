Discussion: The publication titled "CLEAR: A vision to support clinical evidence lifecycle with continuous learning" focuses on leveraging Real-World Data (RWD) to support the clinical evidence lifecycle through a continuous learning mechanism. It emphasizes the integration of RWD into research prioritization, study design, clinical guideline development, evaluation, and shared decision-making. The framework proposed in the article aims to enhance scalability, efficiency, and responsiveness in generating clinical evidence to optimize healthcare outcomes. This aligns closely with the goals of **Clinical evidence generation**, as the focus is on producing evidence to support clinical decisions, improve guidelines, and optimize patient outcomes. While the article touches on informatics and data science, its primary emphasis is on the application of these tools to generate and utilize clinical evidence effectively.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
