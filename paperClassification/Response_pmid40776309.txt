Discussion: This publication primarily focuses on the feasibility of converting electronic medical record (EMR) data into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and utilizing OHDSI tools for analysis. The study involves the application of OHDSI's standardized vocabularies, data transformation processes, and data quality assessment tools, which are central to the community's efforts in maintaining and implementing open community data standards. The use of the Data Quality Dashboard and mapping to OHDSI standard vocabularies further emphasizes the focus on ensuring adherence to the OMOP CDM and standardized conventions. While the study also touches on the use of OHDSI software tools like ATLAS, the primary emphasis is on the conversion process and data standardization, which aligns most closely with the "Open community data standards" category.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
