Discussion: This publication focuses on mapping and harmonizing CVX vaccine terms to the Vaccine Ontology (VO) to enhance semantic classification and standardization within the OHDSI OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). The work involves developing a mapping strategy, utilizing semi-automated and manual methods, and creating a CVX-VO OWL file to support vaccine classification and EHR data analysis. The emphasis on standardizing vaccine information and integrating it into the OMOP CDM aligns closely with the goals of maintaining and improving open community data standards. While the study involves methodological aspects (e.g., semi-automated mapping approaches) and software development (e.g., the CVX-VO OWL file), the primary focus is on standardizing and harmonizing data for use within the OMOP CDM.

Final category: 1. **Open community data standards**
