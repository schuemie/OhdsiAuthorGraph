Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing real-world data to identify longitudinal trajectories of polypharmacy in older adults and their association with mortality risk. The study uses advanced statistical modeling (joint latent class modeling) to characterize clusters of patients based on polypharmacy patterns and validates these findings across multiple databases. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about the relationship between polypharmacy and mortality, which can inform healthcare decisions and policy. While the study employs methodological approaches, its emphasis is on evidence generation regarding disease progression and treatment outcomes, making it most aligned with the **Clinical evidence generation** category.
