Discussion: This publication focuses on the development of a methodology for mapping between clinical and preclinical terminologies using SNOMED CT as an intermediary. The study involves creating mappings, evaluating their precision, and developing a terminology service to facilitate translational research. The work primarily revolves around the creation and evaluation of a systematic approach to bridge terminologies, which aligns with methodological research aimed at improving analytic approaches and scientific best practices in informatics. While the study involves the use of standardized vocabularies (SNOMED CT), the focus is not on maintaining or developing community data standards but rather on the methodology for mapping terminologies. It does not directly involve open-source software development or clinical evidence generation.

Final category: 2. **Methodological research**
