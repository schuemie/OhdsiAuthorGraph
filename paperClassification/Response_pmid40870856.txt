Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing trends in antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens in Korea using data harmonized to the OMOP Common Data Model. The study involves generating clinical evidence about the natural history of resistance patterns and treatment utilization over time. It does not primarily focus on developing or maintaining data standards, methodological research, or open-source software tools. Instead, the primary goal is to produce clinical evidence that can inform antimicrobial stewardship and guide empirical therapy decisions. Therefore, the most appropriate category for this publication is "Clinical evidence generation."
