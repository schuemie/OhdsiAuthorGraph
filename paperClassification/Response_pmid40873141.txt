Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the real-world effectiveness of omalizumab treatment in adult asthma patients and identifying potential biomarkers for predicting treatment response. The study involves clinical evidence generation through the comparison of outcomes between treatment groups, using statistical methods such as propensity score matching and Cox proportional hazards models. The primary goal is to produce evidence about the treatment's impact on severe asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and other clinical outcomes, as well as to explore biomarkers for precision medicine. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on testing clinical hypotheses and generating evidence about the effectiveness and outcomes of a medical intervention.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
