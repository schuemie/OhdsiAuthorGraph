Discussion: This publication focuses on evaluating the real-world effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular, kidney, and mental health outcomes in adults with obesity but without diabetes. The study uses a target trial emulation approach, leveraging electronic health records and applying statistical methods such as propensity score matching and Cox models to estimate hazard ratios for various outcomes. The primary goal is to generate clinical evidence about the comparative effectiveness and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists versus other anti-obesity medications. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study aims to produce evidence characterizing treatment utilization and estimating the effects of medical interventions on health outcomes.

While the study employs methodological approaches (e.g., target trial emulation and propensity score matching), the focus is not on developing or evaluating new methodologies, which would fall under **Methodological research**. Similarly, the study does not involve the creation or maintenance of data standards or open-source software tools, ruling out the **Open community data standards** and **Open source development** categories.

Final category: 4. **Clinical evidence generation**
