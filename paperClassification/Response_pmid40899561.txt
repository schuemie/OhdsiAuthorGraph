Discussion: This publication primarily focuses on the development and implementation of a toolchain for distributed IT development in healthcare research, specifically addressing challenges in transforming routine clinical data into harmonized, research-ready formats using HL7 FHIR standards. The emphasis is on creating an open, modular, and participatory framework for decentralized data transformation and export, which aligns with the goals of open source development. The article describes the technical framework, deployment strategies, and lessons learned from implementing this toolchain across multiple sites, highlighting the creation of software tools and infrastructure to support consistent and reproducible processes in healthcare research. While the publication touches on aspects of data standards (e.g., FHIR-to-OMOP mappings) and clinical evidence generation (e.g., enabling research-ready data for clinical studies), its primary focus is on the development of open-source tools and frameworks.

Final category: **3. Open source development**
