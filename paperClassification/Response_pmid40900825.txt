Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing trends in prescription opioid use across seven European countries using data mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model. The study involves generating clinical evidence by conducting a multinational cohort study to characterize opioid prescription patterns, prevalence, and incidence rates, as well as identifying prescribing indications. The primary goal is to produce evidence that informs public health and clinical practice regarding opioid use trends in Europe. This aligns most closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on generating real-world evidence about disease treatment utilization and prescribing patterns.

While the study utilizes the OMOP Common Data Model, which is part of the **Open community data standards**, the focus of the publication is not on maintaining or developing these standards but rather on leveraging them for evidence generation. Similarly, while methodological approaches are employed, the study does not primarily aim to develop or evaluate new analytic methods, which would fall under **Methodological research**. Lastly, the publication does not focus on creating or enhancing software tools, which would align with **Open source development**.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
