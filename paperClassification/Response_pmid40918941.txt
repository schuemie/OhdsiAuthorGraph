Discussion: This publication focuses on the development of a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to analyze unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data for identifying symptoms and functional impacts of pediatric Long COVID. The study involves methodological innovation in NLP and its application to clinical data, aiming to improve the characterization of Long COVID through computable phenotypes. While the study contributes to clinical evidence generation by analyzing patient data, its primary focus is on the development and evaluation of a methodological approach (NLP pipeline) for extracting insights from unstructured clinical notes. This aligns most closely with the category of **Methodological research**, as the study emphasizes the development and validation of analytic methods.

Final category: 2. Methodological research
