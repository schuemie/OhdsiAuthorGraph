Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing clinical data to investigate the association between autoimmune diseases and skin cancers, specifically melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. The study uses a cross-sectional analysis and multivariable logistic regression models to generate evidence about disease risk and associations. The primary goal is to produce clinical evidence that can inform surveillance strategies and future research into mechanisms of disease susceptibility. This aligns closely with the **Clinical evidence generation** category, as the study is centered on generating evidence about disease natural history and risk factors.

While the study uses statistical methods and data from a standardized source (the All of Us Research Program), it does not primarily focus on developing new methodologies, maintaining data standards, or creating software tools. Instead, its emphasis is on producing actionable clinical insights, which is characteristic of the Clinical evidence generation category.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
