Discussion: This publication focuses on analyzing real-world data to generate clinical evidence about mental health care utilization among people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses the OMOP Common Data Model to identify relevant cohorts and employs statistical methods to examine associations between healthcare utilization and various factors. While the study leverages standardized data models and computational phenotyping, its primary goal is to produce clinical evidence about healthcare utilization patterns and disparities during a public health crisis. This aligns most closely with the "Clinical evidence generation" category, as the research aims to characterize disease natural history, treatment utilization, and associated factors.

Final category: 4. Clinical evidence generation
